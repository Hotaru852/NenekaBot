Has an appetite so huge that she is constantly slaying monsters or doing part-time jobs just to earn enough for her food expenses. 'Pecorine' is an alias that Kokkoro gave her as she is constantly hungry. She fancies the nickname and tells others to address her as such although there's another reason why she has to hide her real name. Her insatiable hunger is a result of the equipment she dons which gives her enormous power but uses up energy at an alarming rate (she reveals that she has it activated all the time for the convenience it brings in everyday life too).\n\nUses some pretty weird phrases that are sort of like her catchphrases (namely 'yabai desu ne\u2606' and 'oissu') because her real world counterpart is not Japanese and speaks in broken Japanese so she's relying on mimi's auto-translation feature (hence her real world lines all encapsulated in quotation marks).",
        "Review": "\nA tank that mostly focuses on staying alive. Has a massive HP pool and does well against both physical and magical, but specialising against neither (unlike Miyako and Kuuka).\nHas a whopping 174182 HP at \u26056 with her EX Skill factored in. In comparison, \u26056 Kurumi and \u26056 Rima have 131722 HP and 147403 HP respectively. That said, Princess Pecorine already has 165352 HP at \u26055 so she'll beat all of them comfortably when her \u26056 comes.\n\u26056 UB will give her a 11820 increase in P.ATK when she uses it at full HP. The buff actually kicks in before the damage despite the descriptions, and will do roughly 195132 damage.\nSkill 2+'s Regen lasts 12 ticks. The P.ATK self-buff on the Skill kicks in first so it'll heal a lot more in practice. At \u26056 (without UB's self-buff), it'll heal for 6555 HP per second."

It does only 1 hit so it will never do more than 999999 9,999,999 damage. (2024/02/15 update increased damage hard cap per hit from 999,999 to 9,999,999).\nSkill 1: 10% of her remaining HP is added onto the base P.ATK buff. If she has under 50% remaining HP when using this Skill, she also gains an additional Barrier that absorbs both physical and magical damage.\nSkill 2: Small AoE attack that also gives Pecorine various effects depending on her remaining HP. See below:\n - If \u226750% HP when using Skill 2, P.ATK boost = 3110 + 10% of total damage done\n - If <50% HP when using Skill 2, heal amount = 19101 + 15% of total damage done (\u26053, factoring in Heal Boost)\n - 60% of Pecorine's remaining HP is added to Skill 2's base damage\nBoth Skill 1 and Skill 2 use Pecorine's remaining HP as reference as soon as the animation starts. Damage you take in between the start of the Skills and the application of the buffs don't affect their potency.\nHighest HP in the game bar \u26056 Pecorine (negligible difference), at 165352 HP with \u26056 Pecorine's Story Bonuses and maxed Unique Equipment.\n[Pre-Unique Equipment maxed out Pecorine] Skill 1 gives a 21933 boost to P.ATK. Skill 2 does 153142 damage with this buff, adding a further 18425 P.ATK buff (if hitting only 1 target). UB with both buffs does 786305 damage.\n[Post-Unique Equipment maxed out Pecorine] 20% of her HP is added to the P.ATK buff, so Skill 1+ now gives a 45511 boost. Skill 2 does 186835 damage with this buff, adding a further 21794 P.ATK buff (if hitting only 1 target). UB with both buffs does 956116 damage.\nWhile powerful, she has abysmally low P.Critical rates (55.7% critical rate against level 350 enemies with Unique Equipment).\nSkill 1+ has 0.46s worth of idle time before it can be used, compared to Skill 1's 0.92s."

This means enemies that enter the field after UB was used (eg. summons) won't be debuffed, unlike Field-based debuffs like Mitsuki and Kasumi's.\nSkill 1 heals for 15770 HP at \u26053 (Rank 33) when factoring in 2 stacks of her buff and her Heal Boost stat.\nShe has 1939 P.DEF and 1767 M.DEF at \u26055.

She has a 100% chance of proccing Criticals against enemies of the same level.\nSkill 1 does exactly half of UB's damage (except with a different damage distribution at 33.33% + 16.67% * 4) so expect it to do a lot of damage with both UB and Skill 2's buffs active.\nSkill 1+ now does 9.1x damage on Critical hits with 1 UB buff stack applied. Below numbers are assuming she's at \u26055.\nSkill 1+ gets additional self-buffs and a boost to the Critical damage modifier. These self-buffs get applied before the attack so it'll always benefit from them.\nSkill 1+ deals 1199089 damage with all her buffs active, if every hit crits (outdamaging UB). Against a level 430 boss (highest Clan Battle boss level as of 2023/05), she has a 100% chance to proc a Critical hit.\nUnfortunately, Skill 1(+) has a long 2.67-seconds animation. You lose the rest of the damage if you cancel it with UB at any point (even when the hurricane has already formed), so she loses quite a bit of damage if skill cancelling happens a lot.",

Kyaru has difficulties being honest with herself and is the typical tsundere. She is actually under orders from a certain individual to capture or kill Pecorine but her kind-hearted nature conflicts with the task and she is in turmoil over picking friendship or mission. She has the unique ability of controlling monsters but she has difficulties controlling it properly.\n\nOften troubled by Pecorine's food choice; Pecorine literally eats anything Kokkoro is no stranger to strange food due to her wild forest life and Main Character being easy-going has no complaints about it if others enjoy it. She always end up eating the weird stuff that Pecorine finds though which strangely enough is usually good.\n\nInterestingly she had a part-time job as a trainer at a monster race course making good use of her ability to control monsters.\n\nThe official spelling of her name (when in English) is not consistent. Official goods have listed it as 'Cal' 'Kyaru' and 'Karyl' (the latter is the official translation Cygames has taken in recent years).",
        "Review": "\nGeneric AoE attacker. Nothing special so she's pretty far down on the priority list unless you really like her.\nFirst character to carry the Panic debuff. Characters afflicted with Panic no longer gain TP from attacking or defeating an enemy, so it significantly slows the opponent's UB activation. Note that most bosses, if not all, are immune to it.\nSkill 2+'s Paralysis debuff lasts 3 seconds. The Skill has a fairly AoE (300) and the lack of a damage is actually a good thing since it ignores Barriers. Its motion is still as slow as before though (approximately 2.1s from wind-up until it hits)."

Summer Kyaru single-handedly took apart and rebuilt the magic team meta, and for a long time after she was implemented, was considered top priority magical character.\nHer \u26056 UB adds on a M.DEF debuff and an additional hit that deals approximately 2/3 of the base damage. The damage output is kinda low for a \u26056 single-target attacker and the additional M.DEF is pretty small, but it means she can apply M.DEF debuffs with all Skills now.\nHer \u26056 UB damage multipliers are pretty low compared to other single-target attackers (eg. Kyouka, Nanaka, Princess Kyaru), but because it's a two-part attack, it can ignore the 850k damage softcap in Clan Battle and Dungeon EX V to a certain extent (like the Little Lyrical trio). Still doesn't see much use though, since there are better options (Anne & Grea, Summer Neneka in particular); even Princess Kyaru could do more damage overall purely with high UB cycle rate."

There is no cap on the buff, so she can snowball hard with sufficient support. The buff itself lasts only 18s so you need heavy TP support for her to work.\nAverage damage output if Kyaru is able to fire UB in succession before her buffs run out (factoring in critical rates from \u26056 Kyaru's Story Bonuses and Unique Equipment, buffs from only UB, and a target with 0 M.DEF).\n1st UB,536865,2nd UB,1146446,3rd UB,2414568,4th UB,5052158,5th UB,10538251\nDungeon boss in EX III and above will wipe your party without fail upon time up (like Luna Tower), so you can't abuse Nyaru in terms of repeatedly using her in multiple runs. Still stupidly powerful though and can cheese bosses with certain setups.\nMechanics like damage softcap were implemented almost entirely to counter her and have heavily affected her ability to perform in content with such mechanics since damage is really the only thing going for her as a needy attacker that contributes to almost nothing else. Can still be extremely powerful in content without damage caps, but they're incredibly limited these days so she's no longer a must-have character today, and if you need a magical attacker, her Princess counterpart and/or Anne & Grea should be your priority."

At \u26055, Skill 2 would deal 68785 damage and her base heal would go up by 1375, resulting in a final heal of approximately 11251 HP.\nUB does 1650859 magical damage on average (factoring in Critical rates) at \u26055. M.ATK buffers do a lot for her (every 1 M.ATK increases UB's damage by 28.8 damage on average).\nWhile her M.DEF debuff is pretty nice to have, the damage on both Skill 1 and Skill 2 are pretty low so her damage output as an attacker is pretty lacklustre despite the extremely powerful UB (until you get her Unique Equipment 1, which then turns her into the strongest attacker).\nThe 2024/02/15 update increased damage hard cap per hit to 9,999,999, while damage soft cap per attack was increased to 10,000,000 (2,000,000 in Clan Battles). Princess Kyaru is one of the attackers that benefited the most from this update.\nHer Unique Equipment gives ridiculous upgrades stat-wise, giving her a much needed Lifesteal and +28 TP Fill Rate. Skill 1+ recovers her TP by a whopping 704, allowing her to overcome her biggest weakness in Clan Battle (i.e. damage soft cap) with pure UB cycle rates.\nAll of Skill 1(+)'s effects take place at the end of the Skill, taking approximately 2.2s to complete, so it quite often gets cancelled if you set her to instant UB as it boosts TP by 144 from action taken when the Skill starts, before getting the remaining 560 at the end of the Skill.\n6% of the damage dealt by Skill 1+ is added on top of the self-buff, which lasts 18s instead of the standard 12s (giving it 100% uptime if uninterrupted). At \u26055, Skill 1+ deals 91714 damage (without Critical), which would add 5503 M.ATK on top of the base amount.\nIt looks weak on its own, but due to the duration, mechanics, and the existence of powerful M.ATK buffers like New Year Neneka and Ameth, it can snowball easily."

Kyaru in particular teases Shefi at every opportunity making baby-speech to remind her of her infantile regression in the story.

Note that the P.DEF debuff is applied after the damage.\nBoth Skills get the boosted effect before consuming Kennzeichen stacks (i.e. if you have 4 Kennzeichen stacks before using a Skill, you gain the boosted effect of 4 stacks, not 3).\nUses Skill 2 often enough to have nearly 100% uptime. With sufficient TP support she can easily maintain near 10 stacks all the time for a pretty decent AoE buff.\nHer Unique Equipment increases Skill 1's base damage, as well as the P.ATK multiplier of its damage to 0.6 per Kennzeichen stack (i.e. a 50% damage boost from Skill 1 to Skill 1+).\nSkill 1+ also gets a P.ATK self-buff.

The base stacks now start from 7 instead of 5 and also gives Shefi a powerful TP Regen buff that increases in potency together with the number of stacks.\n\u26056 UB's TP Regen goes up by 1 per Kennzeichen stack (number of stacks when UB was used, not after you get the 7++ stacks from UB).

She was initially unable to trust her allies and tend to fight alone but gradually opened up to the rest and learnt to trust her allies.",
        "Review": "\nGeneric physical attacker until she gets her Unique Equipment, but what truly transforms her is when you Ascend her to \u26056.\nBlades of Wind is \u26056 Rei's unique buff (lasts 18s), which doubles the potency of her Skills while it is active. This includes her P.DEF debuff on Skill 1+, doubling it to 374 (at level 310).\nDespite the descriptions for Blades of Wind and the game repeatedly calling UBs Skills, it does not boost UB's damage multipliers. It does boost Skill 1 and Skill 2's damage and debuff amount though, so it's still quite powerful."

More towards anti-magical and Arena-oriented.\nHer Taunt is the fastest in the game alongside Akino's (taking 0.03 seconds to come up the moment the Skill is used), allowing it to pull certain fast attacks to her that no other tank can do.\nWhile already an anti-magic tank to begin with, her Unique Equipment boosts that further, giving her 4042 M.DEF with her buffs active and everything maxed out, which is equivalent to an approximate 97.6% magical damage reduction.\nIt's unclear if Cygames noticed their Skill 1(+) in-game description is incorrect, but it actually does two attacks, doing twice as much damage as what it should be doing. It also has a weird damage formula. She's not a damage dealer so it doesn't really matter but I thought it's interesting enough to point out.\nHer \u26056 UB applies the P.DEF debuff first, so it can do quite some damage on more fragile enemies in Arena.\nHer \u26056 has the highest M.DEF in the game, beating even \u26056 Kuuka's."

At \u26055 and 10 stacks, UB deals approximately 1821491 damage (assuming only 1st hit procs Critical, enemy has 1 stack of the Critical Damage boost debuff and Rei has 1 stack of her base buff).\nSkill 1's buff increases by just 0.7 per stack, so the number of stacks don't actually affect it much (+7464 at 0 stacks vs +9641 at 10 stacks). Its damage multiplier also increases by 0.7 per stack, so it deals 485173 damage with 10 stacks (at \u26055 and with her buff, without Critical).\nSkill 2's damage multiplier also increases by 0.7 per stack, so it deals 557432 damage with 10 stacks (at \u26055 and with her buff, without Critical).\nVery powerful attacker that deals a ton of damage. Her UB's damage distribution does a lot of work here since the first hit (60% of total damage) is a guaranteed Critical, despite her mediocre P.Critical stat, and you want to use buffers with Critical Damage buffs with her if possible.\nSkill 1+'s P.ATK buff remains the same, but the damage multiplier goes up by 1.2 per stack instead. At \u26055 (maxed Unique Equipment and her buff factored in, without Critical), it deals 890643 damage."

In simpler terms, every 2500 damage adds 1 P.DEF to the debuff.,At level 310, Hiyori needs to deal 777500 damage with her UB to hit the max 374 debuff.\nWithout Action Speed buffs, she would have 4 stacks of Skill 1's buffs and 3 stacks of Skill 2's buff just 30 seconds into the battle. That sums up to +23016 P.ATK, +100 P.Crit and +20% Critical damage.\nPre-Unique Equipment: 1 minute into the battle, she would have 99355 P.ATK, 1989 P.Critical and +40% Critical Damage at \u26055 without Action Speed buffs. Her UB would do 1440284 damage on average factoring in critical rates.\nLike all other characters dependent on stackable self-buffs, avoid using her against enemies with buff dispels and in battles that end quickly. While very powerful, there are currently very few situations where she can fully make use of her stackable buffs.\nHer P.DEF debuff mechanics means that while she's a powerful debuffer as well, she cannot function as the lone P.DEF debuffer and needs support from others, since she won't be able to hit the damage thresholds needed to boost the debuff otherwise.\nSeemingly had a lot of potential when released, as the level cap increased it gradually became apparent that she's perhaps among the worse Princess Fest characters (pre-Unique Equipment analysis), because her low UB damage multiplier coupled with her weak, stackable buffs put her at a major disadvantage against powerful attackers getting powerful buffs from characters like School Festival Yuni and Ameth. As a comparison, her UB's multipliers are just slightly over half of Cinderella Rima's.\nHer Unique Equipment doubles Skill 1's P.Critical Damage buff and adds on a 100 TP recovery. Idle time prior to starting the Skill remains the same at 0.6s (idle time = the duration spent idling before an action can be taken).\nSkill 1+ recovers her TP by 306 with her TP Fill Rate factored, significantly boosting her UB cycles. The P.ATK and P.Critical buffs get negligible upgrades but the doubled P.Critical Damage buff is massive. Frontmost Hiyori can outdamage \u26056 Djeeta in some situations.\nSkill 1+ is very quick, so she functions well enough even on instant UB. It takes exactly 0.5s for her to receive the buffs, and the TP recovery kicks in a frame after getting the buffs.\nPost-Unique Equipment: 1 minute into the battle, she would have 114368 P.ATK, 2932 P.Critical and +80% Critical Damage at \u26055 without Action Speed buffs. Her UB would do 2128599 raw damage with crit (guaranteed crits against enemies up to level 454)."

Not a damage dealer (her UB's icon sort of hints at this).\nAll her buffs and debuffs last the standard durations (18s for UB, 12s for regular Skills). TP Regen buff also lasts 12 ticks.\nNote that TP Regen buffs cannot stack, the newer one will overwrite the older one regardless of potency (she kind of clashes with post-UE2 Valentine Shizuru in utility). Field-based TP Regens like Akino & Saren's, however, are exceptions to this.\nSeems to be designed for use in Fire Abysmal Quests (Deep Region), where enemy Critical hits can heavily affect one's ability to clear a stage (playable characters' Shadows are all maxed Ascensions (\u26056 if available) and attackers have over 2000 Critical (i.e. they have guaranteed Criticals against players at the current level cap). While she actually hasn't seen much use over there for now (it seems like 2-10 is the only stage where most players use her), this might change as more areas are added."

Information": "An 18-year-old girl who constantly claims she is everyone's Big Sis (let's just close an eye to the fact that there are many characters who are older than her) Shizuru is a member of the secret society Guild Labyrinth. While she was advised by Labyrista to avoid getting too deeply involved with Main Character due to Labyrinth's mission her strong love for Main Character as his 'Big Sis' often goes out of control to the point of being obsessive. Despite her looks and personality she tends to rely on brute force a lot even when showing affection (usually to Main Character and Rino).\n\nShizuru in the Real World is a childhood friend of Main Character's and is equally excessive in showing her love for Main Character. She has an odd habit of headbutting Main Character and Rino to show affection.",
        "Review": "\nAnti-physical sub-tank with a good heal. Her position (3rd from last among Vanguards) makes it hard to use her as a main tank, though not entirely impossible (especially for magic parties).\nHer Barrier, while weak, has excellent range and will cover all Vanguards and a good half of the available Midguards in the game.\nVery inefficient loop pattern. Her damage is very low as a sub-tank, so the sheer number of normal attacks is only a pain on your side.\nHer \u26056 isn't weak (in fact, strongest AoE Regen so far), but note that her Barrier is rather weak and Absorption Barriers will always overwrite Negation Barriers regardless of strength so be careful when you team her up with other Barrier characters.\nSkill 2+ heals herself for 113458 HP when you factor in her buff and massive Heal Boost stats. It's a good Skill but with limited effectiveness thanks to her terrible attack pattern (it does help her fire off her first UB earlier though)."

The self-heal gets a bonus of P.DEF * 1.6, so it heals herself for 12333 HP with her Heal Boost factored in (up to 14272 with regular Shizuru's \u26056 story bonuses).\nSkill 2's P.ATK buff gets a bonus of P.DEF * 2.7 so it boosts the party's P.ATK by a pretty impressive 10095. The party heal gets a bonus of P.DEF * 0.9, so it heals the party for 7659 HP with her Heal Boost factored in (up to 8864 with regular Shizuru's \u26056 story bonuses).\nHer buffs last for the standard 12s (18s for UB's Barrier) but due to her attack pattern, she has her P.DEF buff up almost all the time (and getting double stacks for a short period at the start of her loop), hence the above assumption that she has 1 stack active.\nHer P.ATK and P.DEF buffs kick in before the heals.\nHer Unique Equipment doubles Skill 1's damage bonus from P.DEF, so it does 176985 damage. The self-heal's bonus also doubles, so it heals herself for 47618 HP with her Heal Boost (including Unique Equipment stats) and regular Shizuru's \u26056 story bonuses factored in.\nThe party-wide P.ATK buff on Skill 1+ gets a bonus of P.DEF * 1.6, so it boosts the party's P.ATK by 6984 (factoring in the self P.DEF buff).\nWith Unique Equipment's Heal Boost stat factored in, Skill 2's party heal now goes up to 14617."

        "Review": "\nPhysical tank designed for Arena. Carries a new buff that nullifies immobilising effects (Stun, etc) from enemies. Not really that great in Arena either so save your Jewels unless you really like Shizuru.\nThe skill description means from the enemy quite literally; it does not nullify immobilising debuffs you do to yourself (eg. Summer Hatsune).\nDespite her position as the stun stopper, Skill 1 is quite slow to deploy and gets stopped by many common Arena debuffers like Inori. The second Skill 1 cast won't give you the nullifying effect even if your first cast fails.\n0.00002 * (skill_level + 1) of UB's damage is added onto the buff's multiplier (500000 damage needed to hit the caps regardless of Skill Level). Unfortunately, due to her low damage output, this bonus will usually be a negligible one in Arena.\nHer Bind lasts for 2.5s. All of her Skills have fairly decent AoEs (300 for buffs, 600 for her attacks, covering Vanguards and most Midguards).\nThe P.ATK buff on UB kicks in before the heal so the heal will be stronger in practice. Also, Story Bonuses from other versions of Shizuru add up to 35 in total, bringing up Noir Shizuru's Heal Boost to 119 if you have all of them.\nSkill 1+'s P.ATK buff is doubled and it gets a new P.Critical buff, and the immobilising debuff negating buff and Barrier now activates faster, being capable of stopping the likes of Kasumi and Inori's stuns (but not the super-quick ones like Summer Misogi and Astral Rei)."

She is good at sewing and looks up to Tsumugi as a designer and hopes to open up her own shop and sell apparels like Tsumugi one day.\n\nShe's also a childhood friend of Main Character's in the Real World. She used to be a crybaby when they were little (to the point Main Character nicknamed her Pororiino poroporo being onomatopoeia for teardrops falling non-stop) but she has matured enough to the point that he could rely on her (she still behaves like his younger sister though).\n\nFunnily enough her \u26056 Union Burst when used in videos on YouTube in 2020 caused several YouTubers to get banned temporarily because of its trash algorithm detecting 'Corona' and thinking it's a coronavirus-related content that directly contradicts World Health Organization (WHO) advice.

        "Review": "\nSelf-buffing AoE attacker mainly for offensive Arena.

With Rima, she can hit most Rearguards most of the time.\nHer P.Critical buff lasts for the entire battle so they stack up.\nShe has a 100% chance to proc a Critical hit any enemy in Arena (even those with level limit break). With Criticals, her UB does 504784 damage against all targets within its AoE (50478 damage against an enemy with 900 P.DEF).\nUE2 transforms Skill 2 into an AoE attack with a wide AoE (same as \u26056 UB) and adds on some powerful self-buffs that last 18s and a massive 650 TP recovery (which gives a full TP gauge with TP Fill Rate factored in)."

        "Review": "\nA single-target Rearguard attacker and debuffer in one with a focus on Critical hits. Relatively useless as of now and likely won't see a big improvement in the future.\nSkill 1's P.Critical boost is a permanent boost, like her regular counterpart.\nUB's damage goes up by 35683 (at \u26055) for every ally on your side (including Rino herself). \u26055 UB would do 232759 damage assuming there are no summons when not factoring in critical hits (or 698277 if all 3 hits proc Criticals).\nUB's damage seems pretty standard if you use her in a party without summoners, so it seems like she was designed to be used with characters like Christmas Chika in mind. But if you do that, you risk bosses wiping out your summons and filling up their TP gauges really fast.\nAverage damage of \u26055 UB against an enemy of the same level with summoners (theoretically up to 6 Summons with Christmas Chika and 3 other summoners, excluding Ruu and Luna who aren't technically summoners):\n0 summon (i.e. 5 characters): 590742 | 1 summon: 681306 | 2 summons: 771870 | 3 summons: 862434 | 4 summons: 952998 | 5 summons: 1043562 | 6 summons: 1134126\nSkill 2 does only one hit, so you don't get multiple rolls to get a chance for that P.DEF debuff every time Rino uses it.\nSkill 1+'s base multipliers don't change at all, but all 3 components (including damage) get boosted for each ally on the field (same mechanics as UB's) so it is more powerful than on paper.\nSkill 1+'s P.Critical buff adds 25 for each ally on the field, so it boosts Rino's P.Critical by at least 165 each cast (i.e. if no one dies and no summoner is in party). Remember, this P.Critical buff is a permanent boost.\nDamage of \u26055 Skill 1+ against an enemy of the same level with summoners (without Critical; not calculating average because she has nearly guaranteed Criticals so just multiply by 2 if you want Critical damage):\n0 summon (i.e. 5 characters): 222791 | 1 summon: 254174 | 2 summons: 285557 | 3 summons: 316940 | 4 summons: 348323 | 5 summons: 379706 | 6 summons: 411089\nSkill 1+'s TP recovery gets a +20 boost for each ally so without summoners, Rino would get a 573 boost factoring in her TP Fill Rate stats (or 713 when factoring in the base +90 TP from taking an action)."

Doesn't particularly do well at any of them though (almost behaves like a very clumsy mix of Hatsune & Shiori and Creditta), but not entirely unusable.\nAll her buffs are permanent (including her self-buff on UB).\nHer debuff simply multiplies itself by number of targets, but capped to 4 times (-187 P.DEF if it hits at least 3 enemies, rounding involved). It'll always hit at least one enemy so the actual minimum debuff in practice is twice of what is shown in descriptions (i.e. -94 P.DEF).\nHer UB does 337927 damage if all hits proc Critical. This number doesn't take her Skill 1 buff into consideration but each buff stack increases the damage by 19127 with Criticals (47817 with Unique Equipment).\nHer Unique Equipment boosts the P.Critical buff by 20, the P.ATK buff by 150% and adds on a Regen Field that lasts 8.5s (8 ticks, healing for 21472 HP in total at \u26053).

        "Misc. Information": "Labyrista is one of the Seven Crowns also known as Queen Labyrinth. She is also the Guild Leader of Labyrinth. A major ally to Main Character and was the one who made Main Character her Princess Knight but is shrouded in mystery otherwise. Her Unique Ability is Object Alter which allows her to manipulate objects like buildings and terrain at will making her exceptionally powerful. Her name comes from both her name in the Real World as well as her preference for creating labyrinths for both practical purposes (eg. as a hideout) and in combat both offensively and defensively (eg. taking in Christina's attack from the entrance of a labyrinth and 'reflecting' it back at her by channeling the attack through the exit). She describes her ability as just tinkering with earth and rocks a little which might explain why her powers often have an earth/rock theme.\n\nLikes the colour red a lot which you can tell from her appearances. Even though she has to keep a low profile as she's being pursued she operates a crepe truck in bright red van (...crepe van?) making her stick out like a sore thumb. She also complained about the lack of customers initially since she wore her battle costume while selling crepes making her look intimidating. Her design and Skills have a computing theme too reflecting her expertise with computers.\n\nOne of the only few people who know the truth behind the current Re:Dive world. The reason why she chose Main Character as her Princess Knight (which has been a mystery for years) finally gets answered in her Character Story.",
        "Review": "\nPowerful physical support that boosts the party's damage output tremendously. Fell off significantly since her release, but has made a comeback to top-tier buffer with her Unique Equipment.\nAfter using her UB, Labyrista enters Object Creation form. While in this form, she uses only Acceleration and Export (i.e. no normal attacks, like Muimi) for 3 times each, following up with Initialise, which lowers her TP back to 0 and she goes back to normal after that. This allows her to rapidly buff the party and debuff the enemy with multiple stacks (note that Action Speed buffs cannot stack so she will just refresh its duration) before going back to her normal form. All buffs and debuffs from Skill/SP 1 and 2 last for 12s.\nThe P.Critical Damage buff on her UB is a full-screen Field-based buff so it cannot be dispelled. It lasts until she uses Initalise. Note that she technically has an initial and loop for Object Creation as well, which results in repeated Initialise casts even if the first fails from a Stun, etc.\nThe self-buffs on her UB lasts 24s so they will last the entirety of her Object Creation form, including Initialise itself (unless her Action Speed buff gets dispelled or is overwritten by an Action Speed debuff or a weaker buff).\nShe goes back to Initial Movement after Initialise (quite important to her kit, especially post-Unique Equipment), instead of going straight to Loop Pattern. This means she tends to keep the enemy debuffed and the party buffed all the time even outside of Object Creation form.\nNote that she cannot use UB while in Object Creation form, even if you pair her up with a TP support like Saren. She'll just continue with her Object Creation loop while having a full TP gauge, and ending it with Initialise.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts Optimise's buff potencies (duration remains the same at 12s) and adds on a 200 TP recovery. Together with the massive TP Fill Rate stat on the Unique Equipment itself, this helps her get back into Object Creation a lot faster than before.\nHer Unique Equipment not only boosts Acceleration's buff potencies, their duration also doubles to 24s (same duration as Object Creation itself), allowing you to maintain 3 stacks of the P.ATK and P.Critical buffs for good period of time, and the Action Speed buff having 100% uptime since she'll have enough TP to UB again by the time it expires.\nShe has a whopping 76 TP Fill Rate stat with her Unique Equipment at level 260 and above. She'll almost have a full TP gauge after 4 actions (i.e. Skill 2 \u2192 Skill 1 \u2192 Attack \u2192 Skill 2 | 986 TP).\n2 TP Fill Rate nodes from Princess Knight Enhancements will help bring it up to a guaranteed full gauge."

        "Review": "\nA rather weird and extremely niche defensive buffer, but can be very potent due to the mechanics on her UB.\nThe first thing one might notice is her very odd attack pattern, leading to very low Skill 1 usage frequency. She also does an abnormal amount of normal attacks for a pure support. It may not be obvious but she's not the character you want to use for physical Barriers.\nHer UB looks very weak from numbers, but is actually very powerful. It has a base 0.25 level multiplier, but for every ally behind her, the multiplier goes up by 0.5. This means that just by having one ally behind her, the buff already triples and will get stronger with more allies.\nUB's P.DEF buff,0 ally (i.e. Nozomi is rearmost): 78 | 1 ally: 234 | 2 allies: 389 | 3 allies: 545 | 4 allies: 700 | 5 allies: 856 | 6 allies: 1011 | 7 allies: 1167\nSkill 1+'s self heal,0 ally (i.e. Nozomi is rearmost): 6226 | 1 ally: 9090 | 2 allies: 11954 | 3 allies: 14815 | 4 allies: 17679 | 5 allies: 20543 | 6 allies: 23404\nSkill 1+'s P.DEF buff,0 ally (i.e. Nozomi is rearmost): 47 | 1 ally: 140 | 2 allies: 234 | 3 allies: 327 | 4 allies: 420 | 5 allies: 514 | 6 allies: 607\nSkill 1+'s Regen,0 ally (i.e. Nozomi is rearmost): 579 HP/s | 1 ally: 1378 HP/s | 2 allies: 2177 HP/s | 3 allies: 2976 HP/s | 4 allies: 3775 HP/s | 5 allies: 4574 HP/s | 6 allies: 5373 HP/s\nChristmas Nozomi's Unique Equipment brings massive improvements to Skill 1. The physical damage barrier and P.DEF buff both last 27s, while her Regen lasts 12.5s (12 ticks). Surprisingly high uptime on her P.DEF buff; it lasts for almost 9 actions out of the 10 in her loop."

Your party will benefit from 2 stacks of Skill 1 buffs for the first half of the battle thanks to her attack pattern.\nWithout Action Speed buffs, she enters her loop pattern at around the 1:10 mark, switching to focusing more on TP recovery instead.\nWhile not exactly an attacker, her attacker-like stats (despite being a buffer) + party buffs + EX Skill and UB's decent multipliers allow it to deal 279919 damage (at \u26053, with 2 stacks of Skill 2 active, and Skill 1 left unlevelled at level 1), or 649412 with Critical.\nThere was a trend of leaving Skill 1 at a low level to minimise the lowered TP gain from increased defenses, but there are much stronger damage buffers these days so people generally max her out and use her as a good DEF buffer that also provides offense and TP support."

It has extremely low health and is meant to act as a decoy, but note that defeating anything in this game grants a large TP boost, so this can be a double-edged sword and help boost your enemies' TP fill rates instead (less of an issue at \u26056).\nAt level 310 \u26055 (with Unique Equipment maxed), Chika's UB heals for 60796 HP.\nHer \u26056 UB finally gets rid of the weird heal allies in front of her mechanic and turns into a straight up party-wide heal, healing all allies for 88988 HP (Heal Boost factored). It also brings a bunch of powerful offensive buffs for a physical party.\nOn top of the massive burst heal, \u26056 UB also adds on a Regen that heals for 1144 HP per second, lasting 18 ticks.\nThe Sylph summoned in UB has its stats based on rarity and level, which means it got a massive stat boost. At \u26055, it had 20276 HP, 9104 M.ATK and 0 P.DEF/M.DEF. At \u26056, it now has 53828 HP, 24689 M.ATK, and 888 P.DEF/M.DEF (equivalent to a 89.88% damage reduction)."

Used to be a part of the Infinity Maho strategy where she was used against bosses with powerful AoE attacks; by feeding the boss her summons, she could force the boss to repeatedly UB (and fill your party's TP gauges via damage taken). But this strategy has been crippled after Cygames capped TP Fill Rate at 250 and started adding bosses with UBs that don't provide TP when taking damage from them.\nThe purple Sylph attacks, the blue Sylph recovers the party's TP by 50 and attacks, the green Sylph heals the ally with the lowest HP and attacks. The blue Sylph uses the TP recovery almost immediately after being summoned, so Chika's UB performs somewhat like pre-\u26056 Maho's UB.\nSkill 1+ gains the same mechanics as Halloween Kyouka's, except slightly more powerful. 30% of Chika's M.ATK is added onto the P.ATK buff (+9938 P.ATK with maxed out \u26053). Also, it gets a fixed 100 boost to P.Critical, which is useful.\nChristmas Chika has 39347 M.ATK when everything is maxed out, which equates to an extra 11805 P.ATK buff (a total of 18025). This gave her a role as a P.ATK buffer for Arena together with her TP boosts.\nSkill 2+ gains a large P.ATK buff (goes up by 0.0004 * (S.Lv + 1) * M.ATK, capped to +100% of base value) and increases the duration of the buffs to 18s. Everything else (including AoE AoE has been doubled to 400; 200 was a bug that was patched an hour after UE2 was implemented) remains the same as before. She needs exactly 100000 M.ATK to hit the cap."

Also very niche like her Christmas counterpart, but plays a large role in Arena meta after she got her Unique Equipment.\nSkill 1's multiplier goes down by 0.7 with each usage, so it goes from 933 (1st) \u2192 716 (2nd) \u2192 498 (3rd) \u2192 280 (final buff value)\nHer Regen lasts 8.5 seconds. Perhaps because it already does a burst heal, she also has the weakest single-target Regen buff in the game despite being a healer.\nHer Unique Equipment adds a magical Barrier for allies around herself and a TP burst on herself. The Barrier goes from 15550 (1st) \u2192 12440 (2nd) \u2192 9330 (3rd) \u2192 6220 (final), while the TP burst goes from 1000 (1st) \u2192 730 (2nd) \u2192 460 (3rd) \u2192 190 (final). Her TP Fill Rate is high enough that the 2nd and 3rd casts will still instantly fill her TP gauge (after taking her attack pattern and TP cost reduction into account), making her one of the most annoying thing to face in Arena when she's on the opposite side.\nSees some occasional use in high-difficulty content as a quick and very powerful M.DEF buffer, allowing your other characters to survive powerful magical attacks that would have been impossible even with the likes of Ameth, Karin, etc."

She initially joined only as a backstage staff as costume designer and choreographer but eventually joins them on the stage for their debut concert \ndue to getting tricked by Nozomi (Tsumugi doesn't seem to hate the idea to begin with). She is a beginner when it comes to dancing and singing and secretly puts in extra effort to be able to catch up with the others.\n\nA big admirer of Rei's and dislikes Main Character as he is close to Rei... though she actually shows a good deal of concern for him as well. She likes Rei so much that she behaves almost like a stalker in the Real World which combined with her expertise in binding stuff (and people) makes her look somewhat suspicious.",
        "Review": "\nPowerful Arena character that specialises in displacing her enemies' positions by pulling and pushing them. Tsumugi is one of the stronger Arena characters and can be used both offensively and defensively.\nAn enemy that gets pushed will try to return to their former position in order to attack, but an enemy that gets pulled will stay where they are since you're already within their attack range. This compacts the enemy team, allowing your AoE attacks to hit more targets than usual.\nHer UB has a very large AoE. It is not uncommon to see it hitting all enemies (depends on enemy lineup). Bind works exactly the same as Stun, except with a different animation.\nSkill 2's debuffs are very weak, but it is important to note that Action Speed buffs and debuffs overwrite each other, so her debuff can erase an enemy's Action Speed buff, which is immense (especially against the likes of Monica, who cast her buff only once).\nHer \u26056's AoE, Push and Pull distances all remain the same (Cygames changed the text for the distance from small to large at some point but the amount remains the same). The only things that have changed are its damage and the Bind duration (from 2.5s to 4s).\n\u26056 UB damage,1 enemy hit,113733,2 enemies hit,133211,3 enemies hit,152689,4 enemies hit,172167,5 enemies hit,191645"

Considering how often she uses Skill 1, she can deal a lot of damage and also afflict enemies with a lot of P.ATK debuff stacks.\nHer \u26056 UB turns into an attack that hits all enemies, while applying hefty debuffs that lower the damage of enemies that do physical attacks. Interestingly, her P.Critical debuff is the only one to be affected by Skill level. She also has the first critical damage debuff in the game."

After a 5 second countdown, each bomb deals damage to all enemies (i.e. 5 enemies = 5 bombs = 5x the damage).\nEach bomb has a damage multiplier of (SLv + 1) * 12 + P.ATK. If there are 5 enemies, it would do (SLv + 1) * 60 + P.ATK * 5, making it more powerful than most AoE attacks.\nHalloween Misogi has 52581 P.ATK at \u26055 level 310 (inclusive of EX Skill). Her UB would deal 281565 damage per target if there are 5 targets.\nThe bombs benefit from her own P.ATK buffs, P.DEF debuffs on the enemies, and Misogi gains TP from kills via the bombs (making it easy to do consecutive UBs, though each UB gets weaker as you take out enemies).\nMisogi's bombs will stay on the field and still blow up even if she gets taken out after she sets them up. They don't benefit from P.ATK buffs if she's taken out, the damage will be calculated using her base P.ATK (plus EX Skill).\nShe can actually lay multiple stacks of her UB; they'll all do damage despite the animation showing them to blow up only once.\nHer UB at \u26055 (not including Unique Equipment) deals 56313 damage per bomb (prior to Critical), making her very effective for Dungeon EX IV since it can deal 337878 damage per UB. In fact, she's the best attacker to start off the battle with (until Princess Rei got implemented)."

The AoE is quite small though (150), so don't expect it to hit a lot of targets on the first usage. The Pull effect also does not penetrate Barriers.\nWidely used in Arena as a hard counter to Inori leads (also a top-tier Arena character). Her Stun procs faster than even Inori's. It isn't that useful against actual tank leads though, and Wild Christina also evades it completely as her evasion skill procs even faster."

        "Review": "\nMimi's Halloween version is basically a more Arena-centric version of regular Mimi. Generally does better than regular Mimi's \u26056 as an AoE attacker and is also a better buffer.\nBoth UB and Skill 1 are AoEs. They are regular AoEs and don't share the same AoE mechanic as regular Mimi's Skill 1+.\nSkill 1 is essentially a weaker version of UB, doing approximately 2/3 of UB's damage and having a smaller AoE. AoE-wise, Mimi Skill 1 (730) < Summer Kaori UB (790) < Mimi UB (880). Unlike Summer Kaori, Halloween Mimi can reach Yuki with her UB.\nHer buff lasts long enough to have 100% uptime. Very powerful, although it comes with a small DEF penalty. The penalty is small enough so it usually won't cause major problems, and can even be used to your advantage (i.e. increased damage taken = increased TP gain).\nNote that both Skills have long cast times so they are easily interrupted by Stuns, etc.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 a slight damage boost, as well as shortening the idle time before she can use it (from 1.67s to 1.33s). More importantly, her Unique Equipment adds a ridiculous amount of M.DEF and TP Fill Rate."

Specialist, because in practice it just means she's a crippled AoE character that is useful only against Multitarget enemies.\nMore support than attacker, but the additional damage aspect to her attacks allow her to do more damage than other AoE attackers at times (eg. in Deep Region quests, where the elemental bonus allows her to hit near caps much more easily).\nThe self-buffs on Skill 2 last 18 seconds instead of the standard 12 seconds.\nA powerful debuffer in her own right, but hard to use because she's positioned in front of Princess Rei (and most other Midguards).\nCreditta is also the much better P.DEF debuffer, does not require the boss to be Multitarget, and has powerful utility on top of that. \u2190 less of a problem these days because Elements now mean Creditta doesn't just win almost all the time."

Despite her age she behaves the most mature out of the group and is the brains of the Guild and a typical role model honour student.\nKyouka is wary of men and labels Main Character as 'a suspicious pervert' etc (but doesn't hate him). The game stylises the names she use when addressing Main Character in plain hiragana suggesting that she simply picked them up from others and doesn't actually know their meanings.\n\n'Chiisana Yuuki' (\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u52c7\u6c17) = 'Little Courage'.",
        "Review": "\nA typical burst damage magical attacker. Kyouka is very effective at her job and is one of the better attackers.\nKyouka's self-buff is used often enough for it to be active all the time. Her loop pattern is pretty simple too; she will always follow up with Skill 1 after buffing herself, so as long as you pay attention to it and don't accidentally cancel either Skills, she will perform at 100% potential.\n\u26055 Kyouka has 61226 M.ATK when maxed out (including EX Skill and her self-buff). Skill 1+ will do 612648 damage on Criticals (she has 100% critical rates against enemies of the same level).\n\u26056 Kyouka has 65024 M.ATK when maxed out (including EX Skill and her self-buff). Skill 1+ will do 649108 damage on Criticals.\n\u26056 UB gets a massive increase in damage, as well as the same Critical damage modifier on Skill 1+. It'll do 2205168 damage on average (taking Critical rates into consideration) without external buffs. Far outdamages Princess Kyaru due to the Critical damage modifier.\nHer \u26056 was the strongest single-target magical attacker for a long time (aside from New Year Kyaru in some scenarios), but she got dethroned by other attackers like her own Summer version and Princess Kyaru (with Unique Equipment). Still very powerful, but not high priority.\nFor some reason, she can ignore Kuuka's Taunt and go straight for Miyako with both Skill 1(+) and UB. This strat was widely used for that purpose back when Miyako+Kuuka was popular in Arena (and still confirmed to work as of 2024/01)."

Hasn't really made much of a splash and is heavily in need of \u26056 and UE2 these days.\nSkill 2 is meagre but it lasts the entire battle.\nSkill 1's M.ATK boost is affected by her own M.ATK (46029 at \u26053 level 310, factoring in EX Skill). 20% of her M.ATK gets added as an additional boost, which translates to a 9206 M.ATK bonus on top of the base 4665 M.ATK.\nHer UB has a decent M.DEF debuff, so she's not just purely a buffer. This earned herself a place as a powerful magical support in boss fights (quickly outclassed).\nHer Unique Equipment boosts the M.ATK bonus on Skill 1, increasing it from 20% of her M.ATK to 45% of her M.ATK. At \u26053 level 310, this factors to a 21434 bonus on top of the base 6998 (assuming maxed Unique Equipment).\nOutperformed by New Year Neneka and Stage Misaki in terms of a snowballing M.ATK buffer because Skill 1+ is the only one that snowballs and she doesn't use it often, and her debuff, while decent, isn't particularly noteworthy and is a UB, so she sees very little use these days."

With 30 stacks, each each attack deals 167969 damage, or a total of 503907 damage (at \u26055 with SP Skill buff factored and no Critical).\nEach Butterfly Seal stack adds 0.03 to Skill 1's M.ATK modifier.

With 30 stacks, each attack deals 80182 damage, or a total of 240546 damage (at \u26055 with SP Skill buff factored and no Critical).\nEach attack on Skill 1 applies the M.DEF debuff so it adds up to -250 M.DEF if both target the same enemy.\nEach attack in UB is comprised of 3 hits to further boost her hit count, adding 9 Butterfly Seals per UB. With TP support she gets 30 stacks on the enemy relatively easily.\nLike other multi-attack characters (eg. Misogi & Mimi & Kyouka), Summer Kyouka's Skill mechanics allow her to get past the 850k damage softcap. Low multipliers but with sufficient buffs (i.e. Nyuneka or Ameth), she can outdo \u26056 Summer Kyaru in damage pretty easily.\nHer Unique Equipment adds a self-buff that lasts for the entire battle. The base multipliers on the damage and debuff have not changed, but the Butterfly Seal bonus increased to 0.04, so at 30 stacks, each attack deals 126708 damage, or a total of 253416 damage (at \u26055 with SP Skill buff and maxed Unique Equipment factored, but without Critical and her self-buff). Note that her self-buff kicks in before the attack hits the enemy.\nBoth Skill 1(+) and 2 go up in damage together with the stacks in real time (eg. first hit doing 10000 damage, second hit doing 11000 damage). This however, does not apply to UB, as the damage for all 3 attacks are pre-determined, leading to all 9 hits doing the same damage."

Despite being only 21 Misato exudes extremely strong maternalism and treats everyone like her children (even Main Character who's only 4 years younger). Even monsters and crooks become obedient and reform in her presence with her figure being reminiscent of Virgin Mary. She works as a childminder in the Real World.\n\nNote that the passing rate to become a childminder in Japan is incredibly low at 10~20% so despite her soft and slow-paced easy-going demeanour Misato is likely very intelligent.\n\n'Tennyo no Ikou' (\u5929\u5973\u306e\u5a01\u5149) = 'Power/authority of the Divine Maiden'. 'Tennyo' is a term used to address the maidens that serve the emperor of gods in Japanese (and I believe Chinese and Hindu as well) mythology. Somewhat like 'angels' in English but usually less divine in depictions and closer to mortals.",
        "Review": "\nThe 3rd traditional party healer after Yui and Chika. While her heal amount is the lowest among the 3 (Yui > Chika > Misato), she has a powerful Regen which allows her to keep the tank alive far better than the other two can.\nAt level 310 \u26055 (with Unique Equipment maxed), Misato's UB heals for 45770 HP (50854 at \u26056, excluding the Regen), or 51570 with her M.ATK buff (64936 at \u26056 with both M.ATK buffs).\nHer \u26056 UB gets additional M.ATK, M.Critical and M.Critical Damage buffs while tacking on an extra Regen. The M.Critical Damage buff in particular, is top-tier."

Unlike Kaori though, this typo carries into actual usage too, but it's just a negligible 44 difference so I doubt they'll ever fix it.\nOn top of the typo above, her in-game data shows that the Barriers are supposed to have the standard 18-second duration, but it seems like Cygames' programmers mistyped and they end up lasting the entire battle instead.

It has a relatively small AoE as well so as a buffer, she's almost exclusively a buffer for your Vanguards since Skill 2 tends to go to your tank.\nHer Regen buff lasts for 10 ticks. All of her other buffs last for the standard 12s for regular Skills and 18s for UB.\nLike School Festival Yuni, her UB's buffs won't apply to herself so you miss out on the TP Fill Rate buff. On the bright side, UB's Regen and Skill 1 will still affect her. Skill 1 also has a relatively high usage frequency, making her a potent TP battery.\nSkill 1+ gains negligible boosts to the existing buffs and a magical Barrier. The durations of the buffs (and the Barrier) are the same at 12 seconds."

It increases not only the Poison damage, but also its duration (from 8s to a whopping 24s). If the target was Poisoned, it more than triples in burst damage and afflicts a deadly Toxic debuff instead of Poison.\nOccasionally paired up with Eriko or Student Aoi in offensive Arena as well, to speed up the Poison\u2192Toxic process (actually more or less a must if you're using her to begin with).\nHer \u26056 UB is a slightly more powerful and AoE version of her Skill 1+. The Poison/Toxic debuffs applied are the exact same as Skill 1+'s, in both damage per second and duration.

She gets overwhelmed by the high-class aura over there but 3 odd students appear before her and tries to help her get used to school life...\n\n'Bocchi no Kyouji' (\u307c\u3063\u3061\u306e\u77dc\u6301) = 'Pride of the Loner'.",
        "Review": "\nAttacker with a focus on Poison/Toxic. She can only afflict Poison via her UB, so she needs powerful TP support or another ally to afflict the enemy with Poison/Toxic. There is no restriction to the same character being used in this game, so regular Aoi can also be used.\nWhile her Field is powerful, it deals physical damage instead of pure damage like Poison, so it is subject to defense calculations. Together with regular Aoi, they can quickly cripple tanks in Arena.\nThe key difference between her and regular Aoi is the fact that she carries P.DEF debuffs (and powerful ones, at that), making her viable for more content (whereas regular Aoi is almost Arena-exclusive).\nHer Unique Equipment boosts Skill 1's damage when the main target was afflicted with Poison/Toxic, and adds a P.DEF debuff Field. More P.DEF debuff is always a good thing, but note that this one is very meagre and lasts only 8.5s compared to the standard 12s.\nReplaced by Workwear Aoi for most content. They fulfill the same role though, so she's still an excellent second-string/backup debuffer if you've already used the former in a content that has unit restrictions (eg. Dungeon, Clan Battle, etc)."

        "Misc. Information": "The Guild Master of Diabolos Ilya Ornstein is a legendary Vampire who calls herself 'Ruler of the Night' and once plunged Landsol into fear. She was sealed in an old castle until Shinobu and gang revived her as it was said that she can grant wishes.\n\nIlya in the Real World is an actual Vampire. Both counterparts have lost much of their powers and appear child-like while their actual form is of a bewitching and voluptuous woman. Main Character for some reason is able to bring back her full powers \nfor a short period. Oddly enough her form also affects her mannerisms to a certain extent; it has been commented that she behaves more childishly when she's in her child form.\n\nShe loves tomato juice and does not seem to have the common weaknesses vampires are said to have like sunlight (getting a mild heatstroke at the most) etc but dislikes garlic and crosses. Age is a taboo topic for her (Real World Ilya has also lived for a very long time) as shown when she destroyed an entire dungeon when Fio called her a hag (perhaps because of the trauma she's the only character Ameth addresses with the -san honourific). Her real age is unknown but she's at least over 400 years old since she personally knew Oda Nobunaga (who died in 1582 though she told Main Character that unlike what historians say Nobunaga didn't die in battle but rather lived and died of old age so this might be a few decades off).\n\n'Chi no Keiyaku' (\u8840\u306e\u5951\u7d04) = 'Blood Pact'.",
        "Review": "\nAnother glass cannon like Anna and Yori, but unlike the latter two, Ilya is more of an attacker for boss or regular quests than for Arena.\nThe HP cost is a magical attack that Ilya does on herself, so it is subject to Defense, Lifesteal and Critical calculations. The critical component makes her survivability hard to predict. At the same time, it also gives her a TP boost (via damage taken), allowing her to UB often.\nShe's often used as a pseudo-tank of some sort in some boss fights because of her ability to self-heal.\nThe buff on Skill 1 kicks in before the damage.\n\u26056 UB gets a small boost in damage and heal amount, and also adds two new unique buffs. One lowers incoming Critical Damage by 50% (mostly meant for her self-damage), the other boosts the damage of Skills 1+ and 2 (but not UB itself, much like \u26056 Rei).\nDamage for Skill 1+ and Skill 2 with Twilight Blessings below are assuming she has one stack of Skill 1+'s M.ATK buff and is not doing Critical hits. Notably, Skill 1+ with 4 T.B. stacks does slightly more damage than UB itself.\nSkill 1+ damage,0 Twilight Blessing,135443,1 T.B. stack,164168,2 T.B. stacks,192893,3 T.B. stacks,221618,4 T.B. stacks,250344\nSkill 2 damage,0 Twilight Blessing,81265,1 T.B. stack,109991,2 T.B. stacks,138716,3 T.B. stacks,167441,4 T.B. stacks,196167\nThe Critical Damage reduction buff lasts for 18s, while Twilight Blessing lasts for the entire battle (and does not get used up by Skills 1+ and 2).\nHer \u26056 upgrade gives her enough M.Critical to guarantee Critical hit against enemies of the same level (i.e. including herself), making the Reduced Critical Damage Taken buff a necessity. This buff cannot stack so it won't hamper with your TP gain much.\nHer \u26056 seems to have been slightly nerfed since her introduction during the live stream. Extra Large damage is now just Large damage, and her damage output in the sample video has dropped by around 10m (both against the same Dungeon EX IV boss). \nCommonly used with Barrier carriers, though she doesn't have much synergy with Ameth since the latter requires allies to have a Barrier in order to receive her massive buffs. Karin and Summer Yui in particular, provide a lot for her.\nEven with the Reduced Critical Damage Taken buff, it's still fairly easy to kill her with strong buffers around, so Barriers are strongly advised.

Saren's is 20% and 40% of HP loss on her UB and Skill 1+ respectively, and Ilya's is 600%, 200% and 100% on her UB, Skill 1 and Skill 2 respectively.\nIlya's self-buff on her UB lasts the entire battle. Her self-buff from Skill 2 lasts the regular 12 seconds though.\nHer Unique Equipment powers up Skill 1 slightly (damage boost from HP loss remains the same at 200%), but more importantly, it adds a M.ATK self-buff that not only gets more powerful with HP loss (8% of HP lost is added), but also lasts the entire battle."

        "Review": "\nPowerful magic support, with the main focus in her ability to debuff and tank. While still great at debuffing and tanking, she sees less use these days as more self-sufficient attackers with their own debuffs and supports with both powerful buffs and debuffs get implemented.\nHer UB has a confusing description, but what it does is pretty simple: it gives every ally including herself a MASSIVE Lifesteal buff (1244 at level 310) for the NEXT attack. This means she's very effective at healing attackers.\nHer own M.ATK isn't too bad either (for a support), and she can heal herself for a decent amount after UB. Even at \u26053, she'll heal herself for 29666 HP with a normal attack against a level 250 enemy with 0 M.DEF, or 28590 against an enemy of the same level.\nShe has fairly good defensive stats, making her a decent tank for a magic party when you want to avoid using pure tanks like Ooedo Kuuka. The only problem being that Anna and Ilya are both positioned in front of her, so this only works if you're using other attackers."

AoE has also been slightly increased. The damage bonus from HP loss isn't a lot because the self-damage comes in before the self-buff kicks in, but is enough to make a difference in Arena where she shines.\nFactoring in Skill 1+'s M.ATK boost and self-damage, Yori's first UB will deal approximately 222344 damage before critical calculations (not factoring in lifesteal from attacks in between).\nShe'll gain approximately 782 TP when using Skill 1+ (factoring in self-damage and TP Fill Rate), or 838 TP if Skill 1+ procs a crit."

        "Review": "\nPowerful support that can do a ton of work, be it offensively or defensively. More importantly, the only character that is capable of applying Taunt on other allies, allowing for unconventional compositions that can work extremely well in certain situations.\nHer Taunt lasts for 12s so it's actually fairly decent. It also targets the ally with the highest remaining HP (based on absolute HP, not percentage; it ignores HP from EX Skills though). The DEF buffs she throws on top of it are also top-notch (top among single-target P.DEF buffs).\nShe also has an excellent attack pattern which allows her to keep her buffs up most of the time. Skill 2 has 100% uptime, while Skill 1 has nearly 100% uptime (it expires for a second or two and then she gets it up again).\nSkill 2 heals for 8981 HP at \u26053 after factoring in her enormous Heal Boost stat. It's pretty weak but again, note that she casts Skill 2 fairly frequently so it adds up. Her Critical buff is also top-notch among party-wide ones (2nd highest after Christmas Akari's).\nWhile the first character to have a Taunt buff that can be applied to allies, the HP condition makes it hard to predict and may backfire on yourself, so always do a test run first.\nNote that unlike Magical Kasumi, her debuffs don't go through Magical Barriers if UB's damage is completely negated.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts the DEF buffs heavily, add on a small ATK buff and also an HP Regen buff that lasts 12 ticks (34440 HP in total at \u26053, same duration as the Taunt itself), making it a lot easier to maintain the same target on subsequent casts."

Her stats are almost identical to Angel Yori's (i.e. higher DEF than even \u26056 Akari's), making her an excellent tank/sub-tank as well.\nAt \u26053, Skill 1 heals the party for 33380 HP when factoring in her Heal Boost stat. For a Skill used once every 4 actions, it's pretty impressive.\nVery powerful Skill 2, possibly replaces Ooedo Yuki in certain party compositions. Both do very similar things, except Yori has the much stronger M.DEF debuff and M.ATK buff, and her Action Speed and TP recovery targets the nearest ally.\nPositioned very near Christmas Akari so it seems like they were designed to be used together, with Yori giving Akari the much needed M.ATK boost and TP support. Except against most enemies, enemies target Akari instead if there's no tank in front of them (eg. Noir Kuuka).\nOne of the stronger event \u26051s, has high synergy with New Year Neneka. Do note that the powerful M.ATK buff occasionally makes it hard to target your attacker with Nyuneka's Skill 1+ buff and other single-target buffs that target the ally with the highest M.ATK."

        "Review": "\nAn average support with P.DEF debuffs. Previously seen as nearly useless, but she turned into a niche physical support when her Unique Equipment got implemented.\nHer P.DEF debuff on her UB isn't too bad, but as it's a UB, she has difficulties sustaining it. This problem got alleviated significantly with her Unique Equipment as it provides a large TP Fill Rate boost, so maxing it out is recommended if you often use her.\nHer summoned skull is pretty weak and is only good as a decoy, but it does surprisingly well at being a decoy, perhaps thanks to the timing Shinobu uses Skill 1 at. Many bosses have attacks that hit a fixed number of targets so the skull can help an attacker take a hit.\nDokuro-Oyaji stats with Spiritual Powers (level 310, Rank 33),P.ATK,37115,M.ATK,0,P.DEF,821,M.DEF,612,HP,45779\nP.Critical,1500,M.Critical,0,Evasion,0,Wave HP Recovery,0,Wave TP Recovery,0\nLifesteal,0,Heal Boost,0,TP Fill Rate,0,TP Cost Reduction,0,Accuracy,0\n\u26056 Dokuro-Oyaji still has no Skills, so it seems like he was designed mostly for tanking and Arena uses.\n\u26056 UB has a bigger AoE than regular UB. The Panic debuff applied lasts longer than other Panic debuffs at 12s. If you want a AoE P.DEF debuffer that can do damage as well (besides Creditta), I suggest \u26056 Mitsuki instead of Shinobu.\nSpiritual Powers doesn't power up an existing Dokuro-Oyaji. It's a unique buff for Shinobu that allows her to summon a powered-up version of Dokuro-Oyaji. The buff lasts the entire battle.\nAn unintended effect of giving the two Dokuro-Oyaji's different unit IDs is that the game sees them as separate units, so the powered up version won't replace the regular one when summoned, resulting in having two Dokuro-Oyaji's on the field until the weaker one gets killed. Nothing particularly useful considering the regular Dokuro-Oyaji is very fragile so he's much more likely to die before Shinobu gets to summon the powered-up version, but quite interesting to see when it happens."

Her damage output relies on a unique debuff that works similarly to Chloe's Cowering debuff.\nThe P.ATK buff on Skill 2 lasts permanently. Both the P.ATK buff and TP recovery go up by 100% per Ghost Anchor Seal used up (up to +300%, or 11196 P.ATK and 300 TP in total). Note that this TP recovery is a fixed amount and does not go up with Skill Level.\nUB's P.ATK modifier goes up by 0.4 per Ghost Anchor Seal, up to 3.2. UB does up to 294700 damage but note that this doesn't factor in Skill 2's P.ATK buff (which can stack).\nUB consists of 6 hits (i.e. +6 stacks) and will consume 8 stacks at the end, but the damage is calculated based number of stacks before UB hits, so those +6 stacks are pretty much wasted.\nThe P.DEF debuff on UB is applied only after the damage.\nIf you feel confused about how to use her, she's actually fairly straightforward. Ghost Anchor Seals do not affect her P.DEF debuffs at all, so most people generally set her to Instant UB to prioritise the debuffs and forget about the seals completely.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts Skill 1's damage (more than doubled) and slightly increases the debuff potency (duration remains the same). It also adds on new (and negligible) self-buffs that last the entire battle. Not high priority as it doesn't really change her role by much."

Shinobu and gang awakened her by mistake as they thought she was the legendary vampire but she tags along with them and eventually becomes a member of Diabolos. Players often forget due to Miyako's obsession with puddings but she has an actual reason for joining Diabolos: hoping that Ilya would grant her wish to be resurrected as a human once more.\n\nMiyako in the Real World is an actual ghost. For some reason she's able to log onto the game has a physical form (she weighs 32kg) and is able to consume food making her an 'unexplainable existence' (in Ameth's words).\n\n\u30fb'Pudding ni shite yaru no' (\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3084\u308b\u306e) = I shall turn you into pudding.\n\u30fb'U~ra~me~shi~ya nano' (\u3046\uff5e\u3089\uff5e\u3081\uff5e\u3057\uff5e\u3084\u306a\u306e) = 'Urameshiya' is somewhat of a catchphrase for ghosts in Japanese lores which originates from uramu/urami (\u6068\u3080\u30fb\u6068\u307f 'to have a grudge on' or the grudge itself). Probably quite self-explanatory here. I guess an idiomatic translation that would make more sense for the English audience would be that Miyako is saying something along the lines of I'll curse you~ or I'll haunt you~ playfully.\n\u30fb'Oyatsu no Jikan nano' (\u304a\u3084\u3064\u306e\u6642\u9593\u306a\u306e) = 'Snack time'.\n\u30fb'Suke suke obake nano~' (\u3059\u3051\u3059\u3051\u304a\u3070\u3051\u306a\u306e\uff5e) = I'm a semi-opaque ghost~. Or 'semi-transparent' depending on whether you're a glass is half-full or half-empty type of person.\n\nA horse named 'Purinnishiteyaruno' debuted in horse races on 2020/06/13 (a few days after the anime episode which Miyako debuted). This horse didn't win any race for a long time making her sort of a one-time meme for a while until she finally won her first race on 2021/09/07. She remained sort of a meme though winning only 2 out of 31 races in her career. Ironically this horse is of a famous pedigree; her father Daiwa Major is a sibling of Daiwa Scarlet's (different father) while her grandfather Sunday Silence (Daiwa Major's father) is the father of dozens of famous horses like Special Week Silence Suzuka Stay Gold Agnes Tachyon etc.\nSadly Purinnishiteyaruno passed away in January 2023 days after her last race on 23/01/22 (she was just slightly under 5 years' old). R.I.P.",
        "Review": "\nThe anti-physical tank of the game. While not the only one to do so (i.e. Rima), Miyako does it far better than anyone else.\nOffers near 0 to firepower so she's generally not used outside of Arena, though there are niche uses for her against certain bosses too.\nThe invincibility duration goes up with the Skill level (3 + SLv * 0.01), and caps out at 6s (at level 300). It makes her invincible to everything (even Christina's UB), except damage over time debuffs like Poison and Burn.\nOne of the only two tanks to stand before Kuuka. Since Kuuka takes a lot of damage with her high Taunt uptime, Miyako complements her extremely well and the Miyako+Kuuka used to be a staple in defensive Arena (no longer the case recently with \u26056s).\nInterestingly, she has a flat 0 for her Wave TP Recovery (the only character in the game with 0) so you'll find it hard to fill her TP gauge in Dungeon and regular Quests.\nHer \u26056 UB adds on an additional Evasion buff that  lasts the entire battle. Won't change her role much though, she still deals crap damage and is still a pure anti-physical tank that walls absolutely everything physical."

Even her position and equpiment (from Spears to Fists, hence the relatively high TP Fill Rate) has changed.\nHalloween Miyako is the first of her kind to target the furthest enemy specifically. Many players should remember being tormented by those rock-slinging enemies that targeted their healers; Halloween Miyako is essentially a playable version of them.\nHas a relatively strong P.ATK and M.ATK debuff and TP drain. While her damage output isn't high, there are niche situations where she can do decently well when ATK debuffs and TP disruptions are required.\nCan occasionally be used as a sub-tank the same way as Kokkoro by cancelling Skill 1 mid-animation using UB, though it's not recommended since she has neither a self-heal nor the kind of defensive stats Kokkoro has.\nHer UE1 gives Skill 1 a Panic debuff, which is the same debuff found on \u26056 Kyaru's UB. Panic causes enemies to no longer gain TP from attacking or defeating other units (it doesn't stop them from gaining TP via damage taken though).\nSkill 2+'s damage goes up by 50% if the target has an active Curse/Hex debuff. At \u26055 with maxed UE1 and UE2, it would deal 762927 damage with Critical (maxed UE1 and UE2 would give her near guaranteed Critical against enemies of the same level)."

At \u26055 with all her buffs active, her UB can deal approximately 577716 damage without Critical hits.\nFairly good attack pattern that can be further simplified into a Skill 2 \u2192 Skill 1 \u2192 Attack \u2192 Skill 1 \u2192 Attack loop from start to end; her Field buff won't be active all the time, but Skill 1 should always be the powered-up version for the most part.\nCompetent buffer that gives allies a near-constant 12751 P.ATK buff. There's a short period after her 2nd Skill 1 cast in the loop which gives Skill 1 double stacks, increasing the buff further to 18971. Action Speed buffers will help increase this duration.\nNote that she is the frontmost Midguard by quite a large margin (almost considered a Vanguard at this point) and her buffs will affect Vanguards, most Midguards but not Rearguards.\nHer Unique Equipment doubles Skill 1's damage and adds on a small AoE TP recovery. AoE of the buff remains the same."

She's powerful enough that it is said that 'the Palace is safe as long as Jun is around'... but most of the Guild members have no idea what Jun looks like and they mistook her for an intruder when Christina playfully took off her helmet (only exceptions were Christina being the culprit and Matsuri because she has Jun's voice set as her alarm clock).\n\nJun by family traditions cannot remove her helmet in front of others and gets very embarrassed when her face is seen by others. She sometimes wear a mask under her helmet. Her family in the Real World is comprised of people who cannot reveal their identities.

        "Misc. Information": "A 13-year-old member of NIGHTMARE Tomo is very mature for her age (she's just one year older than Matsuri and one year younger than Miyako). She is also a rare case among NIGHTMARE members as most members come from noble families and she is of commoner birth. Her family developed the Mikuma-style sword art which could be one of the reasons why she was let into the Guild and she is very proud of her heritage. Tomo is friendly and approachable though she doesn't like Christina due to the latter's troublemaker personality (though she has started to see her in better light recently as seen in the NIGHTMARE event).\n\nDespite taking her job seriously Tomo has a playful nature to her: she likes to playfully tease those older than her through skillful wordplay. She looks up to Jun and dotes on Matsuri like a younger sister.",
        "Review": "\nAn attacker that has fallen off the meta, until you get her \u26056, where she becomes a very good buffer that also does decent damage.\nHer UB's self-buff lasts for 24s, making it easy to have at least 2 P.ATK buff stacks active (Action Speed buffs do not stack).\nHer \u26056 UB expands her AoE attacker role, hitting 2 enemies instead of 1. It has relatively low damage multipliers for a \u26056 UB (like most other AoEs), only nearly double of pre-\u26056's UB multipliers. Her damage output will nearly double against Multi-target bosses.\nThe buffs on her \u26056 UB have a relatively small AoE at 150. The P.ATK buff's potency hasn't changed but the Action Speed buff has gone up. Like pre-\u26056, both buffs last 24s so they have an easier time stacking compared to other UB buffs.\nSkill 2's TP recovery procs first, taking exactly 0.5s to proc so if you leave her on Instant UB you'll just lose out on its damage (which thankfully has shit damage multipliers so it's not a big loss)."

While an interesting concept, she's hard to effectively make use of because of this nature.\nBoth Skill 1 and UB take P.ATK and M.ATK combined (1:1 ratio) and output magical damage. The Skill Level multiplier for both are applied only once (i.e. (S.Lv + 1) * x + (P.ATK + M.ATK) * y). They are magical attacks so her massive P.Critical stat is useless.\nAs mentioned, she benefits from both P.ATK and M.ATK at 100% effectiveness with no loss so she benefits twice from buffers that boost both P.ATK and M.ATK (eg. Princess Kokkoro, Ameth).\nHer M.Critical buff lasts for the entire battle so it'll stack, making her a slow-starter type attacker. It's still not enough to make her viable so she's near-useless as an attacker without her Unique Equipment 1.\nHer Unique Equipment gives her a massive boost to her base M.Critical stats. Skill 1+ also gains a rather large M.Critical boost that last 9s. Usable, but not enough to make her competitive with other top attackers so she's still almost never used.\nWith maxed Unique Equipment, Skill 1+ and 2 casts of Skill 2, she has 2134 M.Critical, giving her Skills 100% chance to proc a crit against enemies of the same level.\nSkill 1+ has a high damage multiplier, doing 254618 damage with everything maxed (277010 with Skill 2 active).."

Requires 120000 P.ATK to hit the cap (relatively easy by today's standards).\nHer Unique Equipment 1 significantly improves her kit as a offensive support. The self-buff and damage output does not change, but it now afflicts the target with a debuff that increases Critical damage taken and considering her attack pattern, can land multiple stacks, giving even post-UE1 Summer Rei a good run for her money.

Information": "The 27-year-old vice-captain of NIGHTMARE Christina is a battle maniac and a loose cannon and will go to great lengths to fight (even attempting to start a war between Beasts and Humans by intentionally antagonising Beasts). She also desires to fight Jun one day. That said she is not evil and has her own moral codes never breaking any promise. She is also very sharp and has excellent judgement and leadership skills. She's surprisingly easy to get along with and doesn't seem to mind when Matsuri calls her 'Christina obaa-san' ('Aunty Christina').\n\nShe is actually one of the Seven Crowns known as Regina Geis ('Queen of Vows' which is why she never breaks her promises) and has the unique ability of 'Absolute Offense Absolute Defense' (never missing an attack but always repelling/dodging enemy attacks) but as she has lost her memories like almost everyone else she does not remember being a Seven Crowns member and is only able to bring out her powers partially by instinct. Note that her personality the way she speaks and even the pitch and tone of her voice greatly differ from the first game's Christina.\n\nShe also works as Carmina's Producer.",
        "Review": "\nThe first of the Princess Fest-limited character, Christina is a relatively powerful attacker with guaranteed Criticals on her UB.\n100% uptime on her P.DEF debuff. It's not a powerful debuff but still helpful. There's a small window where you get two stacks on the enemy.\nHer self-buff has good uptime (lasts 15s instead of the usual 12s). She casts it again a short moment after it runs out, so as long as you pay attention to her buff icon, you won't have to fire off her UB without the buff.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts her existing buffs massively, gives it an additional TP boost, and adds on a Critical Damage modifier. This Critical Damage modifier buff lasts the entire battle, so each Skill 1+ cast makes Christina's UB do more and more damage.\nSkill 1+ fully recovers her TP with everything maxed (including Unique Equipment, which gives a nice chunk of TP Fill Rate boost), allowing her to do a lot of UBs in a battle.\nWas on her way out of meta (only useful as a niche 'tank' against Goblin Great) until her \u26056 came along, turning her into one of the most powerful physical attackers. Her immunity to physical attacks also make her a popular lead for high-difficulty content.\nDEF Ignore is a new modifier. Damage is normally calculated as raw_damage / (1 + DEF / 100), but with DEF Ignore, it gets calculated as raw_damage / max((1 + DEF / 100) / (1 + DEF_Ignore / 100),1). For example, damage you do against an enemy with 245 P.DEF comes down to raw_damage / 3.45, but this 3.45 gets lowered down to 2.3 (3.45 / 1.5 = 2.3) with Christina's 50 P.DEF Ignore. The max(blahblah, 1) in the calculation is to ensure this will never go below 1, so it won't actually boost your damage against enemies with lower than 50 P.DEF in Christina's case.\n\nThis modifier works very well against enemies with high DEF (the higher their DEF, the more effective this is), but does nothing against enemies with 0 DEF. Like what its name suggests, the way it's calculated literally allows you to ignore DEF to a certain degree, just not calculated additively like DEF debuffs.\n\nTL;DR Christina's 50 P.DEF Ignore allows her to treat any enemy with 1 to 50 P.DEF as though they have 0 P.DEF. This includes the guaranteed DEF that some bosses have; Christina will do damage as though they have 0 P.DEF as long as boss P.DEF + guaranteed P.DEF is under 50.\nWhile I mentioned that this P.DEF Ignore won't actually boost her damage, it will give her an edge against other attackers in terms of enemies with high guaranteed P.DEF. See this for more information on guaranteed DEF.\nFor instance, level 425 Torpedon (torpedo shark in Clan Battle) has 75 guaranteed P.DEF. Assuming you lower its P.DEF to 0, other attackers will still have their damage cut by 42.86% ((1 - (1 / 1.75)) * 100) after factoring in the guaranteed P.DEF, whereas Christina only experiences a 14.29% decrease ((1 - ((1 - 1 / (1.75 / 1.5)) * 100)."

Her attack pattern is a lazy copy of regular Christina's, which is a good thing since she does a lot of Skill casts.\nNote that buffs that target 'all allies' include the caster themselves too. This means Christina herself gets both buffs on Skill 1 (with coin).\nSomething interesting to take note of is that Christmas Christina's character story bonus includes a +3 to TP Fill Rate. Minor, but nice boost for regular Christina.\nHer Unique Equipment brings slight boosts to some of her buffs and adds on a P.Critical Damage self-buff."

She does not return to her original position, and instead stays at the spot she leapt to and wreaks havoc on the enemy team.\nWhile her P.ATK is pretty low, she has excellent defensive stats that are near a tank's. This is helpful as she takes a lot of hits for your team, since all enemy attacks that target or centre around the nearest target would switch to her, making her a tank with a pseudo-Taunt.\nHas 2243 P.DEF and 2187 M.DEF at level 310 \u26055 with maxed Unique Equipment (2940 P.DEF and 2884 M.DEF with Skill 1+ active).

For example, with 30% HP left, she would deal 237722 damage. \u26056 UB has a larger AoE as well (450 vs 300 pre-\u26056).\n100% of the HP that she is missing is added onto the Barrier's potency on \u26056 UB, making her absurdly tough if she uses UB on low health.

        "Misc. Information": "The 17-year-old Guild Master of Sarendia Orphanage. Saren despite her young age has been through a lot in her life. She was a poor commoner but her father bought his way into nobility at some point and Saren got appointed as the vice-captain of NIGHTMARE. She couldn't see a point to her job as the vice-captain and soon left to start up the orphanage despite being a talented commander. The orphanage is constantly in need of funds so she has to run a side business and scrimp on everything. The children call her 'Mama Saren' although she doesn't seem to like it too much (probably because she's only 17).\n\nShe used to get along very well with a boy when she was little but she can no longer remember his name and face now so she wonders if the boy was just an imaginary friend of hers... coincidentally she and Main Character are childhood friends in the Real World. She is also a classmate of Akino's in the Real World and the two are good friends in both worlds. ",
        "Review": "\nThe original TP battery, and still very powerful by today's standards. Originally thought of as the worst \u26053 attacker when Re:Dive was released, she quickly gained recognition for her TP boosts, which are helpful, especially in Arena.\nThe damage increase on UB is a mere 20% of the total amount of HP that she is missing, and is subject to defense calculations, making it rather insignificant. Skill 1+'s is 40% instead, but still insignificant.\nOn top of the party buffs, her \u26056 UB increases both the base damage and its AoE, and also boosts the bonus damage from missing HP from 20% to 250%. Still a mechanic difficult to make use of, but can occasionally do a lot of damage in Arena and turn a losing battle around.\n20% of total amount of missing HP is added to her \u26056 UB party buffs. Frankly speaking, she's below-average if you're looking her purely as a buffer (at that point you might as well use \u26056 Kokkoro) so you probably want to use her more as an AoE attacker with a TP boost."

Saren is able to take a break from her busy daily life and enjoy a summer vacation with the children and Main Character.\n\nAlso a source of a small flame war against Cygames as the descriptions and the way they handled the matter made people think that Cygames is guilty of misleading representation ('Misleading representation' is an actual law violation in Japan and some other countries). Read the write-up linked below (in Japanese) for more information on this fiasco:\nhttps://togetter.com/li/1381182\nThe gist of it:\n1. Saren was advertised as having a 'Large Action Speed boost' buff but it was discovered that her 'Large Action Speed boost' is the same as pre-Unique Equipment Monica's 'Small Action Speed boost' at 50% potency.\n2. A few bitter players who spent a ton on Summer Saren raged and requested that Cygames buff Summer Saren's buff.\n3. Cygames gave out 3000 Jewels to everyone (R.I.P to players who spent several times of that) claimed that the descriptions on other characters were 'bugged' and 'fixed' them.\n\nTL;DR 'There is nothing wrong with Summer Saren take your Jewels shut up and move on.' --- KMR",
        "Review": "\nExtremely powerful support character that can shine in multiple content, and can be used regardless of party type (physical or magical). Was a top priority but has fallen somewhat in recent times, especially after Liberator Nozomi's implentation. Still a powerful character that sees some use though, especially since Liberator Nozomi doesn't work with magical characters.\nNote that Skill 1 is used only once, at the start of the battle. Arena is the first thing that comes to mind, but it shines also when you are finishing off a Clan Battle boss with low health, since you can use the same party against the next boss if there is remaining time on the timer.\nNote that all her Skills have slightly slow animation. Be very careful of debuffs like Stun, as they can make Summer Saren a paperweight (since the only reason you use her in Arena is for Skill 1). Enemies like Yuki, Kasumi and Magical Kasumi are especially dangerous.\nHer UB is also quite decent. It gives a 50% Action Speed boost, which is the same as pre-Unique Equipment Monica's (translating to a 33.3% reduction in idle time in between actions).\nNote that her UB buffs last for only 12s, as compared to the standard 18s on other UBs.\nUE1 gives Skill 1 a decent boost to the TP recovery, as well as a pretty large P.ATK and M.ATK buff that lasts 20s. The stats on UE1 are not important to her so there's no rush to upgrade it.\nSkill 2+'s buffs are fairly generic buffs that last only 12s, but they're pretty good buffs nevertheless (DEF buffs have become increasingly important). Attack pattern-wise, its buffs have 100% uptime as long as it's not cancelled."

        "Misc. Information": "A 15-year-old member of Sarendia Orphanage. Suzume is a loyal maid of Saren's and also serves as the caretaker of the children while Saren is out (which happens often due to the business she needs to maintain in order to keep the orphanage running). She is extremely clumsy despite being a maid to the point she has been labelled as a 'genius of clumsiness'. Saren treats her more like a very good friend than an employee.\n\nShe comes from a family of servants and her father is known as the 'Superhuman Butler' and her mother is known as the 'Super Maid' and Suzume in the Real World is also Saren's maid and childhood friend (and is just as clumsy).",
        "Review": "\nThe closest thing to a meme in terms of specs prior to \u26056, but suddenly becomes a very reliable DEF debuffer at \u26056.\nRandom factor to her UB's debuff (33.3% chance to succeed, applying a debuff twice as strong). It's not bad per se, but it makes her unreliable since the debuff rate on a failed roll is unimpressive for a UB.\nHer Unique Equipment is not terrible (considering Skill 1's high usage frequency), but it still doesn't give players enough of a reason to use her anywhere.\nHer \u26056 UB gets the same upgrades as Skill 1+ did and finally rids itself of the random nature, making it a reliable AoE attack + debuff now and finally making Suzume usable. Its AoE has also been increased by a small amount (the AoE was already pretty large to begin with)."

At a +60% boost (equivalent to a 37.5% reduction in idle time in between actions), it's actually more powerful than even Summer Saren's UB (and lasts longer).\nSuzume has 38898 M.ATK (inclusive of EX Skill) at level 310 when everything is maxed out. This lets her heal for around 37335 HP, making her a pretty potent healer, though not as comparable as dedicated healers like Yui and Misato.\nDepending on your enemies, her Barrier might prove to be very useful as she uses it twice in her initial movement. It has a very low usage frequency past that though (only 1 in 7 attacks). Most notably, she's useful against Io in Arena.\nHas become a popular defensive Arena character after she got her Unique Equipment since Skill 1's push is now AoE and also carries a Stun.\nHer Unique Equipment gives a massive boost to her Heal Boost and TP Fill Rate stats. She has 40038 M.ATK with everything maxed out (\u26055, maxed Unique Equipment), and her UB heals for 62930 HP."

        "Review": "\nLike her regular counterpart, Christmas Kurumi is a sub-tank of some sort, but is a very niche one that doesn't see much action.\nSkill 1 is the most unique trait of hers. It gives a massive P.DEF buff with a very large AoE (applies to all Vanguards and Midguards, and depending on lineup may reach some Rearguards), but it is a channeling Skill which gets cancelled if she takes damage.\nAs Skill 1 lasts 10s (or until she takes damage), she has a very slow attack cycle, slowing down her TP fill rate and delaying Skill 2 as well.\nHer Unique Equipment 1 increases the number of times she needs to get hit for the P.DEF buff to get cancelled from 1 to 5 times, making it a lot more reliable. It also gives an additional P.DEF boost independent of the channeling to all allies, as well as a small TP boost to herself.\nHer Unique Equipment 2 adds a large P.ATK and M.ATK buff to Skill 2 and massively increases the AoE from 150 to 410, as well as more than doubling its heal amount (approximately +140%) and increasing its duration slightly (12 ticks versus 8 previously)."

Unlike Kurumi and the other children of the orphanage her parents are not afflicted with the Lost syndrome; she's just a runaway girl. She gets along very well with Kurumi and acts like an older sister to her. Ayane is very childish for her age (compare her to Shiori and Tsumugi who are both 14 as well). She constantly carries around with her a bear plush doll she named Puukichi. It was thought that she speaks through Puukichi via ventriloquism (also voiced by Serizawa Yuu) but it was revealed that Puukichi does have a personality of his own making it a mysterious existence. She's also a good cook.\n\nHer Real World counterpart is a rich girl who has difficulty speaking to others so she speaks through her bear plush doll Puukichi. As she is bad with communication she doesn't have friends and thus is very affectionate towards Main Character.",
        "Review": "\nA support with decent offensive stats and kit. She's not a very good attacker, but her UB makes her extremely useful in certain scenarios.\nHer UB sends the nearest enemy flying all the way to the far end of the stage, and Stuns the target after it lands. This means it will take some time before the target is able to return to its original position. Incredibly useful when a pesky enemy tank is in your way.\nFunny but useful effect when used with Rima. Rima's Skill 1 makes her lock on to the nearest target before she charges at them, allowing her to charge into the enemy ranks and take most of the incoming damage.\nNote that the Push and Stun mechanic on her UB are separate components. The Stun is a part of the attack, and missing the attack can cause the enemy to be sent flying but not Stunned. Vice-versa, the opposite can also happen as Push does not always succeed.\nHer \u26056 UB does not change much, it just turns into a small AoE with higher damage and slightly longer Stun (from 2.5s prior to \u26056, to 3s). It is very powerful for an AoE though, and combined with the powerful Push, ramps her up to top-tier Arena character (2020 August)."

        "Review": "\nAyane turns into an extremely powerful but somewhat risky attacker (much less risky with her UE2).\nLike Ilya and Yori, Christmas Ayane is an attacker that does high damage but uses up her HP in exchange for the damage.\nExtremely efficient loop pattern. Her self-buff lasts just 10s (12s with Unique Equipment), but as she uses it with high frequency, it can stack with itself so it's not uncommon to have 2 stacks active.\nHer UB's recoil damage, like Ilya and Yori, is considered a physical attack she does on herself, and hence is subject to Defense, Critical and Lifesteal calculations. The multiplier for the HP cost is also extremely high at 1.8 (compared to 0.6 on Yori and 1.0 on Ilya).\nSkill 2 is very powerful against certain bosses due to the high frequency she uses it at. Most bosses have no resistance to Push, allowing her to cancel bosses' Skills relatively easily.\nHer Unique Equipment 1 almost doubles the P.ATK buff, as well as add on a large Action Speed boost (+75%, which is equivalent to a ~43% reduction in idle time in between actions). Both buffs last 12s.\nHer low defenses and high attack makes her very prone to killing herslf with unlucky Criticals. Her UE2 fixes this by giving Skill 2 a unique buff that changes UB's self-damage to 40% of her remaining health instead, ensuring that she'll never kill herself.\nThe P.ATK self-buff on Skill 2+ lasts the whole battle (180 seconds). Puukichi Cushion and the increased Critical damage taken debuff last 12 seconds, and will have 100% uptime unless cancelled.\nCan outperform even the likes of \u26056 Christina when your party doesn't have a lot of buffs, but she starts to lose the advantage in a party buff-heavy environment (eg. Labyrista, Ameth, Princess Kokkoro) since all she has is a ton of P.ATK (diminishing returns the higher you go).\nPracticality aside, it's possible to cancel Skill 2+ (or use UB before Skill 2+, via the likes of Summer Saren or Liberator Nozomi) to prevent herself from getting the Puukichi Cushion buff. With maxed UE2, she has almost enough P.Critical (very near 2000) to get guaranteed Criticals on her self-damage, allowing her to reliably loop her UB endlessly via the TP gain from taking damage (provided you don't stack so much P.ATK that she kills herself instead)."

Skill 1+ also has the same 150 AoE but unlike Skill 2, its buffs last the standard 12s.\nFairly high damage output (for a buffer) and her powerful buffs make her a pretty good companion to more powerful Vanguard/Midguard AoE attackers."

Maho comes from a rich family and Caon's Guild House was actually a gift from her parents when she came to Landsol (it also functions as her abode). She likes cute stuff and her room is filled with plush dolls. She's also a daydreamer claiming Main Character to be her 'fated prince' and addressing him as 'Prince' and claiming that she is Princess Maho hailing from Maho Maho Kingdom. She is a pacifist as well and is trying to lead Caon in a more peaceful direction and getting past the Race barrier.\n\nMost Beasts are gifted in physique but Maho has a weak constitution and cannot go out much. On the other hand she is extremely gifted in magic and is able to use powerful magic with ease. Her magic is completely self-taught though so she is terribly unfamiliar with the basics of magic and her magic often fails as well.",
        "Review": "\nGood defensive support that performs very well in defensive Arena and can do well in offensive Arena too.\n ,Skill 2 applies Darkness. Enemies afflicted with Darkness has a chance to miss their physical attacks (approximately 50% in Maho's case). It is unknown what the Skill level actually does (Skill Level appears to only increase accuracy).\nDarkness is incredibly powerful against physical attackers. It has weaknesses though: it targets only the 2nd nearest enemy, so it is not very useful against enemies that use 2 or more tanks, and Taunt is also a big problem.\nMaho's heal is powerful, but she doesn't use Skill 1 very often. Her Unique Equipment alleviates that problem somewhat, by giving it a good P.DEF buff and an HP Regen buff, allowing your characters to survive for a longer period (hopefully enough for Maho to cast Skill 1 again).\nHer UB's buffs are not very powerful, but are still useful. TP recovery is also helpful.\nHer \u26056 UB boosts the buffs significantly, increases the TP boost and adds on a small TP Regen (first of its kind). The TP Regen lasts 10 seconds (9 ticks) and is affected by TP Fill Rate.\nBack to top-tier defensive Arena character with her \u26056. An absolute nightmare to face off together with other defensive characters like Yukari and Yui, and can completely hamper most generic attacking teams.\nAlso frequently used in Clan Battles after she got her \u26056. Most notably, she is often used in a New Year Kyaru party and is paired with the likes of Princess Kokkoro, Neneka and/or Christmas Chika for a ton of TP recoveries.\nHer UB, together with Christmas Chika and Neneka, led to Cygames hard-capping TP Fill Rate to stop a gamebreaking strategy that allowed infinite UB for the whole party. Interestingly, every TP recovery/disrupt effect implemented after this update have been fixed amounts (i.e. don't go up with Skill Level). This was how it looked like when taken to its extreme (the patch was applied a month after players broke 2021/11's Sagittarius battle).\nStill a top-tier support in magical parties purely for the TP support and her DEF buff alone. Probably will always be meta given how no one else can replace her in terms of TP support. ( \uff9f\u0414\uff9f)\nAn update on 2024/05/15 introduced some adjustments to Maho's UB and \u26056 UB. The burst TP recoveries will be fixed (i.e. no longer be affected by TP Fill Rate), and to make up for that, the other stat buff components will be boosted. \u26056 UB will also receive a new M.Critical and M.Critical Damage buff. The TP Regen on \u26056 UB won't be affected by this update. ...oddly enough, the TP Regen still remains at 9 ticks instead of 10."

Each hit has a multiplier equal to standard single-target Skills ((SLv + 1) * 20 + ATK * 1.6), so it adds up to a total that is 28% stronger than Kyouka and Summer Kyaru's UB (14% stronger than Nanaka's).\nWhile powerful, her damage output is somewhere in between post-Unique Equipment Summer Kyaru and Kyouka's. As she has no utilities and cannot outdamage Kyouka, she's more of an attacker for your 2nd or 3rd magical party in Clan Battles, albeit top-class for that purpose.\nShe has a TP recovery Skill, allowing her to accelerate. This and her UB multipliers are what makes her powerful enough to go against the likes of post-Unique Equipment Summer Kyaru and Kyouka. She will be truly terrifying when she gets her own Unique Equipment.\nThe random targeting mechanics, while unique, makes her hard to predict when used against anything that isn't a single boss, so view her as a simplistic single-target attacker with self-buff and acceleration.\nWhile luck-dependent, her UB makes her a relatively dangerous opponent to fight against in Arena too (post-Unique Equipment in particular).\nHigh priority Unique Equipment as it gives her M.ATK buff a massive boost, while also increasing the duration from 12s to 15s, giving it higher uptime. It also increases the TP recovered while boosting her TP Fill Rate, and the equipment itself increases her TP Cost Reduction.\nLike post-Unique Equipment Christina, the TP Fill Rate on Skill 1+ is applied before the TP recovery, so it'll always benefit from the boost.\nIf you factor in her TP Cost Reduction stats, this means she's guaranteed to have a full TP gauge with every Skill 1+ used. But do note that there's a small delay on the M.ATK buff, so if you play with instant UB enabled, she'll cancel Skill 1+ with UB (cancelling the buff completely).\nAt \u26055 level 310 with maxed Unique Equipment (Skill 1+ self-buff factored in), UB does 482224 damage (964448 on average with Criticals) and Skill 2 does 150695 damage (301390 on average with Criticals).\nHer UB is one of the earlier multi-attack Skills in the game aside from Shiori's Skill 1. While it has low multipliers, depending on buffer meta, she may become relevant in Clan Battles again in the future."

Can potentially work in Arena too, but more in defensive since the TP recovery is likely going to tanks like Rima or Nozomi in those cases.\nOrder of UB's buffs: \u246027% of Maho's M.ATK before UB was used + base P.ATK buff applied to allies \u2192 \u246127% of Maho's M.ATK before UB was used + base M.ATK buff applied to herself\nThe P.ATK buff on UB is applied before Maho herself gets the M.ATK buff, so the M.ATK buff is more of a boost for Skill 1 instead (unless you manage to cast UB again before the buff expires).\nTotal P.ATK buff from UB \u2192 Skill 1: 34110 (35133 if at \u26055)\nHer Unique Equipment tacks onto Skill 1 a small TP Fill Rate buff and boosts the base buff slightly.

It it because of this that she's sometimes used together with characters like New Year Neneka in order to give a physical attacker an extra powerful P.ATK buff. This strat had been around for quite some time but has gained relevance in recent times due to Anemone's advent (Anemone benefiting from both Cinderella Maho and New Year Neneka's buffs)."

Ilya, Yori) and Luna's Soul Conversion will count.\nFuwa Fuwa Wool can only proc once per enemy attack, even if it was a multi-hit attack.\nSome players theorise that Cygames may be planning to add content that could make Fuwa Fuwa Wool useful but for now, most seem to agree that she's a below-average character that does well at neither support nor damage, so save your Jewels unless you really like her.\nPerhaps against Cygames' intentions, some players are using her as an AoE attacker and she does pretty well with that (granted, it's mostly New Year Neneka being broken as with most magical parties)."

        "Misc. Information": "A 17-year-old member of Caon who speaks in Ryuukyuugo (used by elderlies on Okinawa and Kagoshima prefecture's Amami islands). Kaori is an energetic and carefree girl who who loves dancing and does things at her own pace. She is also somewhat of a natural airhead; she is loose with time and she does not feel embarrassed by her revealing outfit at all (and would not hesitate to strip in front of Main Character if needed). Despite that she has very sharp intuitions as shown when she almost immediately noticed something was off about Christina's combat capabilities and deduce that she was defying physics in some way.\n\nKaori in the Real World is an Okinawan girl and is a high-school karate champion (which explains her sharp battle intuitions).\nUseless trivia time! Ryuukyuugo's (literally 'Ryuukyuu language' 'Ryuukyuu islands' being another name for Okinawa + Amami islands) categorisation as a language or dialect has been something that has been in debate and is a sensitive topic for Japan for a long time. While it shares the same phonological basis as the Japanese language scholars have also said that it bears differences large enough that speakers of either side won't understand each other because of geographical and historical differences. There are 4 distinct views to it: 1). it is a language of its own; 2). it is a dialect of Japanese; 3). it is both; 4). there's no point to arguing about something trivial like this.\n\n\u30fb'Ryuukyuuken' (\u7409\u7403\u72ac) = literally 'Ryuukyuu dog' (also called 'Ryuukyuu inu'). It is a pun on ryuukyuuken (\u7409\u7403\u62f3) 'Ryuukyuu fist'.\n\u30fb'Seichuusen Tsuki' (\u6b63\u4e2d\u7dda\u7a81\u304d) = 'a strike on the midline (of the body)'. Midline refers specifically to one's upper torso (including neck and head); imagine a line drawn from the top of your head to the bottom of your spine.\n\u30fb'Seishin Touitsu' (\u7cbe\u795e\u7d71\u4e00) = literally 'unification of the mind' it means to concentrate greatly.\n\u30fb'Ryuukyuuken-shiki Renkijutsu' (\u7409\u7403\u72ac\u5f0f\u7df4\u6c17\u8853)... 'Ryuukyuuken-shiki' = 'Ryuukyuuken-style'. 'Renki' (\u7df4\u6c17) is a reference to 'renki jushinhou' (\u7df4\u6c17\u67d4\u771f\u6cd5) a method of martial training based on aikido and taijiquan developed by Shimada Meitoku involving relaxation breathing etc. 'Jutsu' (\u8853) just means 'technique'.\n\u30fb'Kyuuyou Karate Hiden no Sho' (\u7403\u967d\u5510\u624b\u79d8\u4f1d\u306e\u66f8)... 'Kyuuyou' is a very old history book about the history of Ryuukyuu (back when it was a kingdom of its own) and is also a fancy term to refer to Ryuukyuu itself these days. \u5510\u624b ('toude' or in modern days 'karate') is the origins of modern karate and is an ancient Chinese martial arts that spread in Okinawa during then. 'Hiden no Sho' simply means 'scroll/book of secret ultimate art'.\n\nThe 'tiida' (\u3066\u3043\u30fc\u3060) in her \u26056 Ascension line means 'sun' in Okinawa dialect. Many players also posted reference to Final Fantasy X's Tidus when they saw the announcement because his name in Japanese is pronounced the same (tiida without the 's' in the English localisation); Tidus' name is also based on the same 'tiida' in Okinawa dialect.\n\nSkill 2's in-game description was wrong (just a typo) and went unfixed for nearly 4 years before Cygames decided to fix it.",
        "Review": "\nExtremely simple but effective physical attacker. One of the top-tier physical attackers as long as she can survive.\nSkill 2 is used only once at the start of the battle. This damage boost is a fixed damage added on top of your damage (i.e. it does not benefit from P.ATK) and can proc Criticals and is subject to DEF calculations. The stronger you get, the more negligible this Skill gets.\nHer loop pattern is very efficient, consisting of only normal attacks and Skill 1 (probably Skill 2's biggest strength, not the bonus damage). Unique Equipment is very helpful despite only boosting Skill 1's damage.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 approximately a 50% damage boost. It has massive stat boosts as well.\nHer position used to be one of her weak points, but with some powercreeping and especially with her \u26056, it has turned into her strength (as long as she doesn't get instakilled) since she can easily fill her TP from taking damage and heal herself via Lifesteal.\nHer \u26056 UB has the same multipliers as Princess Kyaru's UB (Extreme Large damage descriptor), so like the latter, \u26056 Kaori benefits massively from P.ATK buffs. It also carries a  permanent buff of her own, which kicks in before the UB hits.\nStill has survivability issues, but as long as she can stay alive, she deals massive damage with each UB and has a quick TP fill rate thanks to her being a Fist-based character and her position."

        "Review": "\nRidiculously powerful AoE attacker, it wouldn't be weird for her to be a gacha character but they made her an event giveaway.\nArena Holy Trinity combo: Summer Kaori + Rima + Saren. Rima's Skill 1 late entry allows Kaori's UB to hit more enemies, Saren's TP boost will go to her almost all the time (depending on the lineup).\nHer UB gains a 0.5 multiplier for every enemy hit, hence Rima being so important in Arena. It has phenomenal damage for an AoE if it catches several characters.\nAs a Fist character, she has high TP fill rates and TP cost reduction, so it is not uncommon to see her firing off her UB multiple times in a row when she manages to finish off an enemy with the initial attack.\nShe also carries an Action Speed buff, making her useful even in content like Luna Tower and regular quests. Her self-buff is also very powerful considering it carries the Action Speed buff as a bonus (compare it to say, Halloween Shinobu's self-buff).\nComplicated-looking loop pattern, but she uses Skill 1 quite often, allowing her to compact the enemy party to increase the number of targets her UB can hit.\nEnemies to watch out for when using Summer Kaori + Rima: Ilya (both Skills will hit Kaori, taking her down quickly), Summer Kyaru + Neneka (AoE nightmare), Yuki (specifically targets 2nd nearest enemy while staying outside Kaori's range), Rino (staying outside her range).\nContinuing the trend after the likes of Mimi and Summer Mifuyu, Summer Kaori is also another character that gains a large boost to an AoE Skill's damage through her Unique Equipment. Unlike them, her AoE doesn't change though.\nHer Unique Equipment also doubles the Push distance on Skill 1 and adds on an AoE Stun that lasts 1.5s, further boosting a presence in Arena.\nRelatively useful in Dungeon EX IV as a starter attacker, since the number of targets allow her UB to hit 247545 damage (\u26055 and without her self-buff factored in)."

        "Misc. Information": "A 15-year-old new member of Caon who is very intelligent and loves deductive reasoning. Unlike most other Beasts Kasumi is calm and more brains than brawns though she moves on instinct like other Beasts when it comes to investigations often putting aside her job at Caon for the sake of investigation. Her main job at Caon is the investigation of the Shadow incidents. She hires Main Character as her assistant (splitting her already low salary as a new member with him). She was previously the Guild Master of a solo Guild which specialised in investigations called 'Quo Vadis'.\n\nKasumi in the Real World is Main Character's junior in school. She enjoys deductive reasoning as well and looks up to the famed detectives in mystery novels. She is rather shy and has no close friends besides Main Character and looks up to him. Unlike her Astrum counterpart she isn't a confident individual (according to her 'unlike mystery novels there are no foreshadowings in real life so it's hard to deduce accurately like the detectives in the novels do') but she's clearly as intelligent and has correctly deduced many of the inner workings and truths behind Astrum's mysteries.\n\nContrary to popular belief Kasumi is not a cat-type Beast but rather a dog-type (modelled after a doberman) possibly a parody of Doberman Deka (a popular manga written by the same author as Fist of the North Star; it's about a detective nicknamed Doberman because of his ruthlessness on criminals). Also not widely known but the propped up ears of a doberman are actually not natural; this happens only when you crop the ears when the dog is still young and is considered a cruel practice in many places (forbidden in some countries). A doberman has naturally droopy ears instead.",
        "Review": "\nA very powerful debuffer who does decently in regular Quests and is a very powerful Arena character. Her beefy defensive stats (especially with \u26056) makes her a popular defensive lead since the position makes her Bind AoE even deadlier.\nSkill 1 is very fast. It'll very easily stop most other characters' first Skill usage. With her Unique Equipment, the damage almost triples and the Bind duration is extended. The AoE is fairly large, and depending on the lineups, may even reach the likes of Halloween Misaki. ...and Halloween Misaki's UE2 counters her Bind completely (2023/10/23).\nSkill 2 comes up right as the Bind on Skill 1 ends. Her Confusion debuff lasts a whopping 7.5s, and stops enemies from using UBs and make them attack their allies instead (including using Skills 1 and 2).\nHer UB has the most powerful M.DEF debuff in the game. Was rarely used against bosses until New Year Kyaru happened, to which she became an often companion. Had mostly faded out of non-Arena content ever since Nyaru strats got neutered, but is recently making a comeback as part of a brute force party for Absymal Quests together with New Year Homare.\nDeceptively large AoE on her UB Field despite its appearances. The AoE increases further upon \u26056, from 300 to 410.\nCountdown is basically just a delayed attack that does damage 5 seconds after being applied. It's hard to tell because all the damage numbers overlay each other perfectly (unlike Halloween Misogi's UB), but each Countdown does damage to all enemies.  This means that if there 5 enemies with Countdown, it'll do 5x the damage to each enemy (still piss poor damage but can be sort of annoying to more fragile attackers in Arena).\n\u26056 UB will do 111470 damage to each target if 5 enemies were in the AoE."

        "Review": "\nSimilar to her regular counterpart, Magical Kasumi is a debuff specialist, and an Arena one for most parts. You could say she's the Arena specialist (almost universally agreed that she's the most troublesome enemy to face in Arena).\nNothing much to say about her since she's a very straightforward debuffer, in a good way. Very powerful in Arena (currently among the strongest) and will give your opponents a tough time by delaying their UBs significantly, especially when together with \u26056 Io.\nYou can almost feel the malice when Cygames gave her massive DEF stats considering her role. Even \u26056 Rino would have trouble trying to finish her off (and failing to finish her off \u2192 TP fill from taking damage \u2192 UB, forming a vicious cycle).\nUnlike \u26056 Io's UB, the TP drain portion on Magical Kasumi's UB seems to go through magical Barriers even if the damage gets completely blocked.\nDepends on your lineup and the enemy's, but is a natural counter to Summer Saren because it hits right before Saren's TP recovery kicks in. It doesn't work if there are Rima's on both sides, causing the Bind to go to Rima instead.\nHer Unique Equipment adds on very powerful debuffs and increases the TP drain by a very small amount. Note that the debuffs last only 8s."

Note that it doesn't boost just M.Critical Damage but all Critical damage in general.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts both debuffs on Skill 1 and also in a rather odd decision, adds on an additional attack with negligible damage (but always procs crits).

The biggest shocker about her is probably the fact that despite her looks and her position as the Guild Master of Elizabeth Park (a subsidiary Guild of Doubutsuen a Guild consisting almost exclusively of Beasts) she's actually not a Beast but rather a Human wearing a cow costume.\n\nShe gives a nickname to everyone she meets mostly by repeating the first two characters in their name (eg. Shiori \u2192 Shioshio). Tamaki is the only exception to this being called Makimaki instead (probably because 'Tamatama' sounds like a crude nickname for testicles); we haven't seen interactions between her and Kasumi yet but I'd imagine she'll call her 'Sumisumi' for the same reason ('Kasu' itself means dregs/leftovers but is also often used colloquially as a crude term for 'scum' 'rubbish' etc so 'Kasukasu' is not the nicest nickname out there).\n\nElizabeth is the name of her cow.\nTsukami no Teppan Neta' (\u63b4\u307f\u306e\u9244\u677f\u30cd\u30bf)... this is an interesting one to explain. 'Tsukami' means a 'grab'. 'Teppan' literally means 'metal plate' (which doesn't make much sense) but idiomatically something 'solid' 'sturdy' 'sure-fire' etc. Together they refer to Mahiru's habit of telling jokes 'Tsukami no Teppan Neta' is her 'go-to (i.e. the most solid) joke which is used to grab/hook the audience's attention' (which all comedians will have as part of their gag routines sometimes referred to as their 'shticks'). That part is actually pretty easy; what is harder to explain is 'neta' (\u30cd\u30bf). You can simply think of it as 'neta' = 'joke' but for a full explanation see below:\n\n'Neta' is derived from 'tane' (\u7a2e) which means 'seed'. Rice grows from seeds and rice is the livelihood of our lives (or at least the Japanese's) making 'tane' being idiomatically seen as 'the most important part of something' the 'core'. There was a trend during the Edo period to reverse words (dem Edo hipsters!) while keeping its meaning and this resulted in the term 'neta' being formed. It has been used in many different ways since then so there's no proper English translation for it since 'core' alone isn't sufficient as English is not as context-dependent as Japanese is. One use is as the 'core' of a magic trick (i.e. how it works). Another is as the 'core' of nigirizushi (i.e. the hand-pressed vingered rice in sushi). Another is the 'core' of a gag which has evolved to mean the joke itself (i.e. neta = 'joke'). Another more modern one is 'meme' (which kind of originated from the 'joke' definition anyway).",
        "Review": "\nAttacker with several different debuffs. She's somewhat like a single-target version of Ninon.\nDoes not seem to belong anywhere. She's too weak for boss fights, and single-target physical characters don't quite cut it for Arena (a few exceptions aside).\nShe's not terrible, but she's not spectacular either and is above-average all across the boards and there are better alternatives for every area.\nHer \u26056 UB gets a massive upgrade in both damage and the things it can do. Damage boost (it also gets an additional AoE attack on top of it), the Stun duration has been increased to 5 seconds, and the AoE Confusion lasts for 4 seconds.\nThe additional hit on \u26056 UB seems to have its AoE calculated from the target's position after the push (needs confirmation), allowing it to hit even Rearguards depending on the main target.\nSkill 2+'s Stun is quick enough to stop Inori's Stun."

Mahiru casts it right after it expires so she should benefit from it all the time.\nDue to Skill 2's damage being based on enemy count, the damage listed in the in-game Skill description is not accurate since that is based on 0 enemy. The numbers on this spreadsheet start from 1 enemy count instead.\nSkill 1+'s P.ATK buff multiplier goes up by 9 per enemy (i.e. +50%), P.Critical buff potency goes up by 25 per enemy. It will boost for at least 8397 P.ATK and 75 P.Critical since there's always 1 enemy at least.\nSkill 1+ P.ATK buff,1 enemy: 8397 | 2 enemies: 11196 | 3 enemies: 13995 | 4 enemies: 16794 | 5 enemies: 19593 | 6 enemies (EX IV Dungeon): 22392\nSkill 2 damage (\u26055 with Skill 1+ buff),1 enemy: 71313 | 2 enemies: 87013 | 3 enemies: 103833 | 4 enemies: 121772 | 5 enemies: 140831 | 6 enemies (EX IV Dungeon): 161010\nWhile her UB damage is still pretty mediocre, she now performs considerably well against multi-target bosses thanks to Skill 1+ and Skill 2's mechanics (as long as Skill 2 can reach all targets on the boss)."

        "Review": "\nAn anti-physical tank with a very unique Skill and loop pattern. Used more offensively than defensively though.\nSkill 1 makes her lock onto the nearest enemy and dash into the target from outside the screen. This means your 2nd character will take most of the first turn attacks for 2s or so, before Rima dashes in and tanks.\nHowever, that also makes the enemy party travel further in to reach your 2nd character, allowing your AoE attacks to hit more targets than usual. Note that this is a double-edged sword, as the same goes for the opponent's AoE attacks.\nHer Unique Equipment makes it even better, as it gains a powerful physical Barrier that is applied to your entire party. Many debuffs can be blocked if the accompanying damage is completely negated. This includes Tsumugi's pesky Skill 1.\nAs Rima uses Skill 1 only once, her loop pattern consists of only normal attacks and Skill 2s, in a 1:1 ratio. This means she Stuns the nearest enemy a lot.\nWhile not as tough as Miyako due to a lack of self heals (and Miyako has her invincible ghost form), Rima is also a very tough physical tank. Her P.DEF is far higher than Miyako's (with buffs factored in).\nMany players tend to stay away from her because of her looks, but if you want to do well in Arena, it is advised that you raise her. She also works rather well for difficult content like Luna Tower.\nThe number 1 tank in Arena, thanks to Skill 1+'s mechanics, \u26056 adding a ton of bulk to herself and also \u26056 UB being pretty annoying in general.\nHer \u26056 UB not only deploys a nasty physical Barrier that makes it much harder to get through opponents using her in Arena, it also adds an AoE push which can mess up your party positioning if you don't defeat her quick enough, causing your other characters to get hit.\n\u26056 Rima vs Rima (if they are the only Vanguard tanks) often creates some sort of weird phenomenon where the enemy Rima and Vanguards pushes past your Rima so targeting can turn very awkward.

Her UB while Metamorph Princess is active deals a ton of damage, with multipliers identical to \u26056 Rei's.\n10% of Rima's P.ATK is added onto Dance with Me's party buff. She has 60932 P.ATK in Metamorph Princess form at \u26055 (not factoring in her perma-buffs from Beauty and Beast), so Dance with Me boosts the party's P.ATK by at least 12003.\nThe party buff from Dance with Me has 100% uptime (while she is in Metamorph Princess form) because of her attack pattern, even stacking with itself for a few seconds.\nOn overall, she is a good buffer but don't expect too much out of her overall damage despite her impressive UB damage, because she spends most of her time using buffs instead and her normal UB does no damage.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts Skill 1's damage massively. It also boosts both the buff and TP recovery on M.P. Skill 1, while adding an additional P.ATK buff to all allies. The buff is small, but it lasts the entire battle like the self-buff.\nThe boost in TP recovery in Unique Equipment significantly increases her UB cycle rate and in turn, turns her into a respectable attacker and buffer in one."

Shiori's official Guild is Caon but she was sent to Elizabeth Park as a loan member as she is frail and needs recuperation. She often stays in bed but when she feels good she gets out to help with \nchores earning and sending money home. Note that while she gets sick easily and claims that she has no strength she can exert strength akin to the typical Beast's in times of need to the point she can carry a bed on her own (leading to players \nnicknaming her 'Frail Gorilla' which her in-game capabilities also shows). She is also quite the intellectual (being able to read ancient text as well) as reading is her hobby and she spends a lot of time reading while in bed. Main Character often \ndelivers mail to Elizabeth Park and Shiori usually gets him to bring her books that she wants getting really happy when he does come.\n\nShiori is half-Elf half-Beast (tiger-based unlike other Caon members) and Hatsune is her actual older sister (unlike Hatsune her Beast features are more prominent). She looks up to Hatsune as she has supernatural powers and can help people out and strives to become like her and one day be strong enough to protect her. She is an extremely proficient archer with a deadly aim.\n\nHer Unique Equipment is a hand-made good luck charm from Hatsune.",
        "Review": "\nPowerful long-ranged attacker (one of the reasons why players jokingly call her a 'Frail Gorilla', since she's supposed to be sickly). Extremely high TP recovery, leading to high UB cycle rates.\nSkill 1's description is a little misleading: it fires 3 arrows regardless of the number of enemies. If there are \u22673 enemies, they'll hit the 3 nearest enemies (1 arrow per enemy). If there is only one enemy, the target gets hit 3 times, making this Skill a lot more powerful than it seems.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts this already strong Skill. The TP recovery also powers up, speeding up her UB cycle. Her Unique Equipment itself adds a ton to TP Fill Rate so it has high levelling priorities if you use her often.\nOne problem she has is that the TP recovery on both Skills kick in way before the arrows hit; if you play on Instant UB (a.k.a. SET), she'll be cancelling her own Skills a lot.\n\nSkill 1's TP recovery occurs 1.3s after the start of Skill 1 (roughly at the highest point of the firing arc), but the 3rd arrow hits only roughly 2.3s after the start of Skill 1.\nSkill 2's TP recovery occurs 0.2s after the start of Skill 2 (almost instant), but the arrow takes roughly 1.3s to hit.\nWhat makes her so powerful is that the self-buff on her UB lasts for the entire battle, so the more you fire it, the stronger she gets. This is why you don't want to cancel her Skills by accident because they do quite a lot of damage.\nTP gain (assuming she doesn't get hit):,855 (Skill 1) \u2192 1557 (Skill 2) \u2192 UB \u2192 162 (normal attack) \u2192 324 (normal attack) \u2192 1179 (Skill 1+) \u2192 UB\n\u26056 UB works like Skill 1; each arrow deals 241742 damage (not factoring in her self-buffs) and applies the P.DEF debuff. Against a lone boss, you'll be looking at twice the damage and debuff.\n\u26056 UB's damage output has gone up so much that her manual vs Instant UB problem has almost become a non-issue these days. You should observe her doing pretty similar damage output be it on manual or full-time Instant UB."

Skill 1 and Skill 2 both have the same 300 area, which will affect all Rearguards and a good half of Midguards.\nThe damage portion on Skill 2 has massive multipliers that are higher than the average attacker's UB. Combined with her generic attack pattern (one Skill 2 usage every 5 attacks), she does pretty decent damage overall for a buffer.\nHer Unique Equipment massively improves Skill 1. Not only are the buffs powered up (negligibly), it also gets an additional P.Critical damage buff and the buffs now last 18s instead of 12s. The AoE stays the same though."

Ironically Shiori is the one who tends to take up the role of guarding the place and while Rin is concerned for Shiori she doesn't really do anything about it because she's lazy.\nShe loves anpan (red bean bun) and acorns. She vastly prefers koshian (smooth red bean paste filtered through a sieve) to tsubuan (unfiltered red bean paste with skin and all).\n\nShe's not just petite for her age (at just 144cm tall) but is also rather heavy for her height perhaps from doing nothing but lazing around and eating anpan and acorns all day. While she does not look like it like Shiori she is an official Caon member and considering Elizabeth Park's request and Caon deciding to send her it can be inferred that she is (or was) actually a capable combatant.\n\n\u30fb'Otesei Anpan' (\u304a\u624b\u88fd\u3042\u3093\u3071\u3093) = 'Handmade sweet bean bun'.\n\u30fb'Kahou wa Nete Mate' (\u679c\u5831\u306f\u5bdd\u3066\u5f85\u3066) = 'Good things will come if I sleep and wait'.",

This was a major bottleneck for her and the reason why no one used her...\nHer Unique Equipment not only boosted her M.DEF buff and gave her additional offensive buffs, it also expanded the AoE by a little, allowing it to reach more Vanguards.\nHer Unique Equipment also gives her a massive Heal Boost stat increment, allowing her to heal for more. At level 310 \u26055 with everything maxed, she heals for 24549 HP, making her a decent sub-healer as well.\nWhile niche, there are quite a number of scenarios where having a levelled Rin makes an extremely large difference. Level her if you don't want to make life difficult for yourself.\nHer \u26056 brings a ton of boosts that turn her into a very powerful buffer (the M.DEF and TP Fill Rate buffs in particular). The base heal's modifiers stay the same though, so it improves only slightly (from the stat gain). The extra heal is the same Lifesteal buff found on Akari's UB.\nHer base heal on \u26056 UB heals for 29843 HP."

It is stronger than her UB but it carries an Action Speed self-debuff that lasts for the entire battle so she's meant for short-term battles.\nIt's not entirely impossible to use her in other content like Luna Tower. She uses Skill 2 often enough to nearly have 2 stacks active at all times (1 stack would expire for 1 attack at the end of her loop before she gets it up to 2 stacks again).\nIt is recommended (almost a must) that you pair her up with an Action Speed buffer like Kokkoro or Summer Saren, because of how Action Speed buffs and debuffs overwrite each other and her self-debuff is very extremely heavy.\nLowers all enemy Vanguards and most Midguards' P.DEF by 374 (468 with Unique Equipment) within her first 3 actions. This makes her a rather powerful Arena support for short-term battles.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts Skill 1's damage and P.DEF debuff potency massively, as well as increasing the P.DEF debuff duration to 24s.\nThe damage gain on Skill 1+ is high enough that she can easily take out fragile characters with a lucky Critical (her Critical stat sucks though), making her a popular Arena character as it's also a very fast Skill. Often paired with Inori (post-Unique Equipment).",

She comes from an extremely wealthy family and due to the way she was brought up is ignorant with the ways of life lacking knowledge about the typical commoner's lifestyle and has a very bad sense of direction. Has the makings of a great merchant making proper and fair dealings and punishing the corrupted merchants but also extremely loose with her spending as well often getting reprimanded by her Guild members.\n\nViews Saren as a good friend and rival. This relationship holds true for their Real World counterparts.",
        "Review": "\nA mediocre attacker with a Regen and decent defensive stats (for an attacker), Akino is a decent character for tough quests in which your attackers just need that extra bit of health to survive.\nFrankly speaking, pretty useless outside of the abovementioned scenario. Not that she's a terrible character, but she's just half-assed in whatever she does and there are better options.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1's counterattack a massive damage boost, as well as a multitude of buffs including a Taunt which makes her counterattack easier to proc. But she isn't a good attacker so it doesn't really mean a lot.\nMostly used for that Regen, but it's not the strongest available and there are better choices these days.\nHer \u26056 UB gets a massive boost in damage, outdoing even the likes of \u26056 Rei's UB damage multipliers. 2nd highest multipliers by far after Princess Kyaru and \u26056 Kaori's UBs, if not counting those with special requirements like Christmas Akino and \u26056 Mifuyu.\nHer self-buff on her UB lasts for 18s, but is applied only after the hit connects. If you can get her to UB again before it expires, her UB can deal up to 849212 damage without critical (factoring in Skill 1+'s buff and not counting Damage Field).\nThe Physical Damage Field will fully benefit from the self-buff. It lasts 15.5s and does a total of 454935 physical damage (with all self-buffs). Note that it is subject to defense calculations and does not proc Critical hits.\nAkino will stay still for the full 5 seconds after the initial attack on Skill 1 (or until she gets hit), so manually cancelling the skill with her UB is advised, as her damage output and survivability drops when playing on Auto-battle (no longer an issue with Instant UB Mode now).\nWas one of the high-priority \u26056s for high-difficulty content because her high HP, Lifesteal + UB damage and Barrier make her a good attacker that can also somewhat tank, but her priority has fallen heavily in recent times."

With maxed stacks at \u26055, UB does 644762 damage, while Skill 2 does 214920 damage.\nSimilar to Chloe's self-buff that comes with her unique stacks, Akino's bonus buffs on Skill 1 lasts only 30s despite being used only once. Hopefully her Unique Equipment turns them into permanent buffs.\nThe following buffs are considered 'status buffs': DEF UP, ATK UP, Critical UP, Critical Damage UP, TP Fill Rate UP. Skill 1's buffs themselves gives Akino 3 stacks at the start of the battle so she technically needs just 22 more (Unique Equipment increases cap to 50 stacks).\nHer UB is quite decent when maxed, but considering the amount of buffs needed, it does look pretty lacklustre on average damage output over 1 battle. Skill 2 should make up for it though, considering her attack pattern.\nAll of her buffs on Skill 1+ are now permanent, including the newly added party-wide buffs. Not that it makes a huge difference, but the newly added buffs also mean she starts out with 5 stacks now.\nWith maxed Seiya no Kirameki stacks at \u26055 (with Unique Equipment and factoring in Skill 1+ buffs), UB does 1494325 damage (2988650 on average with Critical rates), while Skill 2 does 498108 damage (996216 on average with Critical rates).\nHer UB has monstrous multipliers when she has 50 Seiya no Kirameki stacks, beating even the likes of \u26056 Kaori's. At 50 stacks, each point of P.ATK adds approximately 43.8 damage on average (factoring Critical rates), so buffs matter to her even more than before.\nNote that School Festival Yuni and Karin's SP Skill only adds 3 stacks to Akino, probably because it adds 20% of the target's base stats (Akino has 0 M.ATK so that adds to nothing). Despite that they're probably the fastest buffers for Akino's Skill 1(+).\nIf Akino gets a magical version one day (like how Pecorine got Christmas Pecorine), it might change things for her a little.\nWhile Skill 1+ is extremely powerful on paper, whether she becomes relevant or not is a different matter. End of the day she's still heavily-dependent on supports just to build up her stacks, since she cannot build stacks by herself.\nOne major advantage she has over other buff stack-based attackers is that while her buffs do get dispelled, Seiya no Kirameki itself is not treated as a buff so it doesn't get dispelled."

She usually works part-time at a taiyaki stall but operates secretly as the legendary Phantom Cat a beautiful phantom thief that steals from unscrupulous merchants and distribute their ill gains to the poor. One day she heard of a rumour of a merchant (Akino) holding a grand party. Having suspicions about it she infiltrated their Guild House as Phantom Cat. But she was easily caught due to the existence of two experienced warriors Mifuyu and Yukari. Once she learnt that Akino is a fair merchant with no wrongdoing (and together with some threatening from Akino) she joined their Guild. She's the main reason why Mercurius Foundation secretly operates as a Guild that punishes unscrupulous merchants. But at the same time she's also very faithful to her greed and is often reprimanded by her Guild members for it.\n\nShe loves cats and often spends a lot feeding strays (again often getting reprimanded for her spendings). She has the ability to control cats as she likes. Like cats she hates getting wet.\n\n'Kimagure' (\u6c17\u307e\u3050\u308c) = 'Whims'.",
        "Review": "\nThe anti-magic attacker of the game, Tamaki specialises in taking down magic attackers with pinpoint accuracy.\nShe was once one of the top Arena attackers, but has lost her position due to the abundance of tanks with Taunt, magic characters having enough bulk to withstand her hits these days and the fact that she's fragile.\nSkill 1 carries a weak M.ATK debuff as well, but this debuff may cause her UB and Skills to go off target so it somewhat contradicts her playstyle.\nHer Unique Equipment unfortunately, doesn't boost Skill 1's damage multipliers. It only doubles the M.ATK debuff's potency (and is still a rather weak debuff) and add on a Stun. The Stun is useful but honestly, higher damage multipliers would have been preferable.\nOccasionally used in Clan Battle against enemies where her TP drain would be useful. She uses it 1 out of 5 actions, making it more reliable than Summer Tamaki's.\n\u26056 UB gets an additional damage boost against enemies that use magical normal attacks (only normal attacks despite the descriptions), as well as a very powerful P.DEF debuff (2nd most powerful in the game if purely by amount via a single action).\nTakes down most magical attackers in Arena with a single UB. Characters like \u26056 Yui and \u26056 Maho will still survive under the right conditions though.\nEffectiveness as a boss attacker is a little iffy due to the normal attack check. She shines against magical bosses but many high-difficulty bosses are physical bosses with magical attacks, so against these, not only does the P.DEF debuff not kick in, it also does meh damage."

        "Misc. Information": "A 20-year-old member of Mercurius Foundation and perhaps the most level-headed of the 4 main members and often serves as their strategist (and also obsessed with efficiency). Mifuyu was one of Akino's father's subordinates before joining the Guild and is among the more experienced warriors in the game; she's nicknamed Dragon Slayer because she has defeated dragons before. She is also Main Character's 'teacher' and taught him how to fight albeit not for free. She is very strict with finance and is quite shrewd when it comes to money and takes up many part-time jobs (mainly as a mercenary) in order to earn as much as she can often neglecting her health in the progress. It's also because of this that she is always on the lookout for bargain sales and her strategical mindset is put to good use when she plans her shopping for bargain sales beforehand getting the items she wants with great efficiency.\n\nMifuyu in the Real World has also done a ton of different part-time jobs and according to her has done 'part-time guerilla in conflict zones' 'part-time mountain rescue in the Himalayas' 'part-time nurse' though it is not known if she was joking (Mifuyu doesn't seem like the type to lie though). She apparently worked as a part-time Aikido instructor as well which was displayed when she took care of hooligans in the family restaurant she was working part-time at with ease.",
        "Review": "\nA Midguard sub-attacker and sub-tank. Rarely used anywhere because she's neither a main tank nor a main attacker and is somewhat half-assed. If she's used, it's mainly in high difficulty regular quests where the Midguards get targeted a lot.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts her durability even further, and gives a pretty good Regen. The problem being her Regen's AoE is extremely small, making it hardly useful for anything in general.\nHer \u26056 UB is somewhat like Rem's; it does a second hit that hits all enemies if the target was Stunned (or afflicted with any other immobilising debuff) when UB was used. Note that the Stun durations do not stack so it's a 4s Stun for all enemies, not 8s for the nearest enemy.\nHer \u26056 UB has a very high multiplier by its own (coming close to \u26056 Rei's), and has the highest multipliers against the base target if it was already Stunned (or any other immobilising debuff). Since it depends heavily on these debuffs, she's Arena-centric for most parts.\nList of immobilising debuffs for reference.\nDue to her reliance on other characters with immobilising debuffs, she often goes in and out of Arena meta, when powerful and quick debuffers appear (eg. Inori, Rem). Outside of that, she's also frequently used for her Skill 2 since its Stun procs very quickly.\nTechnically, her \u26056 UB has the highest damage potential against a single target in the game (24 hits \u00d7 9,999,999 damage), but it's only doable with very niche setups involving Maho, Cinderella Maho, Neneka, etc with Advance buffs like the ones in Legion War and End of Elysian."

Not only that, the AoE attack's damage multipliers jump up to almost 8 times.\nThe key differences between her and Mimi are the frequencies of their AoE attack, the speed (Mifuyu is slightly faster), and Mifuyu staying outside the AoE of popular attackers like Misaki and Neneka, making her a bigger threat. Her AoE is slightly smaller than Mimi's though.\nSkill 2+ has two components: the first set of buffs last for 12 seconds, while the second set of buffs last for only 6 seconds."

She previously worked under Akino's father as an accountant and when she came over to the Guild she was placed in charge of the Guild's finance. She is also an expert with Landsol's laws and punishes unscrupulous merchants using the law as her weapon. She was once a holy knight displaying her skills when she and Mifuyu captured Tamaki. Mahiru described her as being so good at healing that regular doctors cannot even hope to compare.\n\nWhile she is usually a serious and dependable person she is also an alcoholic and her behaviour when drunk is especially terrible (something she is well aware of). She once said that her parents brought her up very strictly so her alcoholism could be some sort of recoil when she finally became free from them. It is so bad that she once depleted all the alcoholic beverage available in town. If you haven't noticed all of her Skill names are names of cocktails or liquor (Prelude Fizz is the name of a Japanese cocktail so you probably won't find it in English).\n\nShe's a little troublesome/picky when it comes to love matters which is the reason why she's still single at 22.",
        "Review": "\nA very powerful anti-magic support with a powerful single-target heal, Yukari is one of the most prominent Midguards and is commonly used across multiple contents. Also one of the most commonly used Arena characters.\nAs you might already know, many debuffs can be negated, if the accompanying damage is negated completely. While her magic Barrier isn't strong, it is enough to negate a lot of pesky boss debuffs. Being a UB also means you can choose when to use it.\nHer heal is one of the strongest in the games (not counting Summer Kokkoro's, which is a UB). It is boosted even further with her Unique Equipment, which also gives a massive Heal Boost increment (fully maxed out Unique Equipment is recommended).\nShe also carries a very potent TP recovery Skill. Note that she uses it twice in her initial movement, making it very powerful for short-term battles, Arena being one of them, allowing a character to use UB twice in succession as soon as the battle starts in certain lineups.\nDue to the nature of her TP recovery Skill, you can sort of predict who it'll go to, to a certain extent. If everyone has the same amount of TP, it doesn't go to a random target, but rather a fixed target (determined by distance and position).\nHer combination with Yuki is one of the commonly abused combos in Arena. Her TP recovery will occur first, going to the character with the lowest TP, and Yuki's TP recovery will then go to the same target, allowing said character to fire off UB very quickly.\nAlready one of the best support characters in the game, her \u26056 Ascension doubles the potency of her Barrier, adds on a decent M.DEF party buff and a party heal.\nYukari has 29246 P.ATK and 272 Heal Boost at level 310 with everything maxed out (inclusive of EX Skill+). She would heal the party for 32983 HP. Not the highest, but certainly very useful considering her other utilities, especially when her UB didn't even heal prior to \u26056.\nAs a testament to her prowess in Arena, Yukari has consecutively clinched the no. 1 position for most often-used Midguard in Arena for 2 years in a row (Anniversary Report). Almost a guaranteed seat in Arena setups, be it defensive or offensive Arena.\nGained a ton of HP at \u26056, and with her naturally high defensive stats, makes her a much better sub-tank than before."

However, she trades the powerful heals for powerful offense-oriented buffs and debuffs and instead of boosting an ally's TP, she saps an enemy's TP.\n25% of her own P.ATK is added onto UB's buff (+7100 at \u26053). By no means a small amount, but quite negligible because of how hilariously powerful the base buff itself is (lasts 18s).\nSkill 2's AoE seems to be rather large at 400, covering almost all characters (except for Kyouka, Halloween Kyouka and Halloween Misaki).\nWill definitely be very useful for high difficulty content, and potentially useful against certain Clan Battle bosses too so it's worth leveling her.\nHilariously powerful M.Critical debuff on Skill 1+, currently beating even \u26056 Misogi's UB's P.Critical debuff in value (which scales with Skill Level but she'll need to reach level 279 to catch up)."

Each stack increases UB's P.Critical buff by 5 (i.e. +135 P.Critical with 7 stacks).\nNote that the numbers for the buffs in UB's skill description are for the base amount (i.e. does not take stacks into consideration), so they are more powerful in practice since the buffs only proc if she has at least 3 stacks (P.ATK buff starts at 3732 instead of 933).\nEach stack increases Skill 1's built-in 1.5x Critical Damage modifier by 0.0625.

The number in the Skill preview is merely the base debuff, so even against a lone enemy, it should debuff for twice of what the base debuff shows, making it more powerful than it seems.\nShe's positioned in front of Princess Kokkoro, so that rules her out for situations where you want to use the latter as a tank. She does however, stand behind Yukari.\nCan be used in Clan Battles against Multi-target bosses, but there are generally better options since Summer Nanaka's damage output and debuff are average at best. Regardless, most of the good magic characters are limited so she still has an edge in that area.\nCan wreak havoc in Arena, considering her Skill 2 instantly applies a 467 M.DEF debuff on all enemies right from the start of the battle. Position-wise, she'll frequently get destroyed by AoE attacks before she gets to use Skill 1.\nUnlike most other Skills that are attacks and buffs in one, Skill 1's buff kicks in before the attack lands, so the attack always benefits from the buff. The buff itself has a relatively small AoE, but should comfortably reach most magic characters except characters like Kyouka.\nEach enemy targeted by Skill 1+ to boost the M.ATK boost by approximately 3888 and the damage's M.ATK multiplier by 0.4. Remember, Skill 1's buff kicks in before the buff, so the damage goes up by a ton with more enemies.\nSkill 1+ M.ATK buff,1 enemy targeted: 8553 | 2 enemies: 12440 | 3 enemies: 16328 | 4 enemies: 20215 | 5 enemies: 24103 | 6 enemies (EX IV Dungeon): 27990\nSkill 1+ damage (\u26055, assuming target has 0 M.DEF),1 enemy targeted: 87155 | 2 enemies: 117942 | 3 enemies: 151841 | 4 enemies: 188848 | 5 enemies: 228968 | 6 enemies (EX IV Dungeon): 272195\nOne might think she can fulfill a position similar to Summer Hatsune in Arena as an attacker after getting her Unique Equipment, but as mentioned above, her positioning makes it such that she usually dies before she gets to use Skill 1, or do nothing much against a wall setup."

Seems to be designed for Arena in general as an anti-wall attacker.\nAll her Skills (including UB) have a 300 AoE. The Burn debuff's damage goes up by 2799 per target hit (3x of the base damage) and it lasts for 6.5 seconds (6 ticks). Damage in description is assuming 0 targets so it'll do more in practice.\nThe Damage Field lasts 8.5 seconds (8 ticks). As with all Damage Fields, this is based on Nanaka's M.ATK and unlike DoT debuffs like Burn, is subject to defense calculations, and does not proc Critical hits.\nThe Burn debuff will miss if UB's damage is fully nullified by a Barrier. The target(s) that nullify the debuff will however, still be added into the headcount and other target(s) that failed to nullify the debuff will take the full brunt of damage (eg. UB hits 3 enemies, 1 of them nullifies the Burn but the other two will still take Burn damage equivalent to 3 targets hit).\nHer Unique Equipment increases Skill 1's Field AoE from 300 to 410. The duration has been increased, lasting 12.5s (12 ticks). The new TP Fill Rate debuff's AoE is still 300 however."

        "Misc. Information": "'I am Hecate of the Gale!'\n\nA 17-year-old member of Twilight Caravan Annerose von Stechpalme or Anna for short is also known as the Walking Tornado (\u6b69\u304f\u7adc\u5dfb 'Aruku Tatsumaki'). A bounty hunter with grandiose delusions (chuunibyou to be exact but I can't find a better English term to describe it) she is called the Walking Tornado because of how she stirs trouble (whether intentional or not) wherever she goes like a tornado. Anna given her personality fancies the nickname too. Despite her affiliation with Twilight Caravan she also claims to be the reincarnation of the leader of a group called The Order of Gehenna Immortals. She also claims that Main Character her sworn friend is the incarnation of Zweiritter the leader of the group's 2nd squad and also her nemesis in their previous lives.\n\nWhile a chuunibyou character Anna's powers are also the real deal (at least in Astrum). And something common with the chuunibyou theme terms that she made up are mostly prononounced differently from the way they are written in a random mix of Engrish and German.\nDespite her personality she has more common sense compared to her Guild members (except Ruka) though it's because they are too crazy in comparison (Eriko in particular is in a completely different league of her own making the others look mild in comparison). If you look aside her chuunibyou side she's just a scatterbrain who cares for her friends. Anna is also the author of a book called Meifuu Senki which details her previous life's story. Surprisingly it has a rising fanbase. She spends most of the money she earn from bounty hunting on buying magical tomes.\n\nAnna in the Real World is not much different except that she has no powers. She studies in a prestigious all-girls school and despite her hobbies (which she doesn't hide) she managed to make a lot of friends in school.\nShe's also Japanese named Hiiragi Anna. Annerose von Stechpalme is just a name she made up. She thinks 'von' makes her name sound like an aristocrat's (meaning 'of' in German and supposedly a common particle in German nobility) and 'Stechpalme' is just the German name of 'hiiragi' (\u67ca) a flower.\n\nHer naming sense seems to have been influenced by the Tales of series? Luke fon Fabre of Tales of the Abyss also has the 'von' aristocrat particle in his name (erroneously translated to 'fon' for some reason).",
        "Review": "\nPowerful magical attacker... or at least that was what Cygames intended for her to be. Initially a powerful Arena attacker, but she quickly got ousted from Arena meta with Kyouka and Ilya's appearance.\nSkill 2 is very unique in the sense that it is a kamikaze (suicide bomb) move. Its damage was very high when the game started, but with Unique Equipment and powerful attackers getting implemented, quickly got overshadowed. She rarely gets to use it anyway.\nHer UB lowers her base P.DEF and M.DEF to 0 for the rest of the battle. It does have high damage multipliers for an attack that hits all enemies, but that is a heavy price to pay for.\nLong thought to be a near-useless attacker until her Unique Equipment got implemented, which catapulted her into the ranks of the top-tier magic attackers for boss fights. While not as powerful as Summer Kyaru and Kyouka in firepower, she has very powerful M.DEF debuff.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 a damage boost and good M.DEF debuff. What makes her so powerful is her loop pattern (see above), having at least 2 M.DEF stacks active at all times (3 stacks for a few seconds when the loop resets).\nWhile no longer the top choice with Neneka and post-Unique Equipment Summer Kyaru around, she's still a good choice for boss fights when you've already used up those two (or if you don't have them). The difficult part is fitting her into a party where she can stay alive.\nAvoid using her UB. Her damage output is about the same whether you use it or not. It's easier to pay attention to the likes of Kyouka and Anne (i.e. attackers which you want to use UB only when their buffs are active) when you don't have to use her UB at all anyway.\nFun fact 1: Skill 1+ is very unique in the sense that it applies the debuff before it deals damage (despite the descriptions). While she's rarely used in Arena, this odd mechanic allows her to strip enemies of their magic-negating Barriers with ease.\nFun fact 2: Skill 2 grants invincibility once the animation starts, so it will never fail as long as she can proc it.\nFun fact 3: Skill 2's self-damage can be cancelled with her UB if you activate it manually, allowing her to do damage but still stay alive to fight. Well, not for long obviously, since you have only \u226610% HP after that. And it can only proc once, of course.\nFun fact 4: Skill 2's self-damage happens only after you deal damage to your enemies, so Anna stays alive if she manages to finish off all enemies with it. Which almost never happens.\nWhile still a powerful and consistent M.DEF debuffer without a doubt, she has fallen off the grid since the addition of many powerful debuffers like Homare, especially since she cannot be used on Auto.\nHer \u26056 gets a massive boost in damage multipliers, as well as a large M.ATK boost that lasts for 8 seconds. Unfortunately, the DEF self-debuff remains the same so it seems like the UB is designed as an Arena glass cannon (unless you know a boss' attacks can't reach her).\nThe M.ATK buff on \u26056 UB kicks in before the attack hits so it'll always benefit from the buff.\nWhen fully maxed out at \u26056, she has more than enough M.Critical to guarantee crits against non-bot enemies in Arena, even against enemies 10 levels above herself (i.e. Level Limit Break)."

The 2nd Vanguard magical attacker in the game after Christmas Ilya.\nNote that Skill 2's M.ATK debuff penalty to allies is based on base stats. EX Skills and buffs are not affected.\nHas 90319 M.ATK at \u26055 with Skill 2 and EX Skill+ factored in (97317 with UB's self-buff factored). Her UB would deal 536977 (576865) damage, or 1073954 (1153731) damage on average with Critical rates factored.\nNote that her self-buff on UB kicks in after the damage so you'll need to fire subsequent UBs within 18 seconds for UB to benefit from it.\nActual numbers should go much higher than the above numbers, because Summer Anna is designed to be used together with supports that don't need M.ATK (eg. Princess Kokkoro).\nWhile not completely unusable, do note that she is a Vanguard and has terrible defense stats, so she will be very fragile. Also, if you need a healer, you'll also want to use a physical healer since healers rely a lot on their base ATK stats too.\nHer Unique Equipment massively buffs Skill 1, but doesn't change the fact that the debuff kicks in after the damage. Probably won't move her away from meme status considering how she messes up other magical attacker allies (besides Magical Tomo to a certain extent).\nGenerally thought of as a meme character but she actually saw action in Clan Battle in 2021 July, with the Summer Anna, Yukari, regular Anna, New Year Kyaru, Luna setup. New Year Kyaru would be able to fire off her UB before Summer Anna's Skill 2 kick in, and the self-buff just snowballs off from there to make the debuff penalty look insignificant in comparison. Still a meme character for most parts, but not entirely unusable."

The buff and debuff on Skills 1 and 2 have nearly 100% uptime due to her attack pattern.\nSkill 2 uses up \u301030% + 0.03% of her M.ATK\u3011 (capped at 60%) of her remaining HP. She has higher defenses than other versions of herself and Ilya, but still needs a lot of babysitting from healers and/or barrier buffers because the self damage ignores M.DEF.\nThe bulk of her damage comes from UB and the stackable buffs; her first UB would do just 238833 damage with Critical, but her 10th UB would do 652796 damage with Critical (at \u26055, without factoring in M.ATK buffs from others).\nSkills 1 and 2 have garbage multipliers, but they can do significant damage against multitarget bosses when she stacks up enough self-buffs. After her 10th UB, Skills 1 and 2 would do 326749 and 392099 damage with Critical respectively.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts Skill 1's damage and adds on a large M.ATK debuff, as well as extending the debuff duration to 18s (the new M.ATK debuff also lasts 18s). The AoE remains the same."

She is a warm-hearted person who can never ignore someone in need but because of her personality gets pulled into all sort of incidents and trouble easily. But she solves the problems with grace because of her magnanimous nature and skills with the sword causing not only her allies but even her (former) enemies to look up to her and call her 'Anego' ('Big sis' but more commonly used in gangs to address a lady boss) out of respect. Ruka doesn't like being called 'Anego' though.\n\nDespite the eccentric members of her Guild she is able to lead them well being the only person in the Guild with common sense.\n\nRuka enjoys fishing and works part time at a fishmonger's. She's one of the few characters that originate from Toogoku (a ficticious country in Astrum based on Japan).",
        "Review": "\nA multi-talent tank but Cygames tried to make her do too many things, resulting in each area being rather lacklustre.\nHer UB's P.DEF debuff is very powerful, but with a slow TP fill rate, is also very hard to take advantage of.\nShe is rather fragile when compared to the other tanks.\nBoth Skill 1 and Skill 2 are slow in animation. Skill 1 won't be able to make it in time to redirect quick Turn 1 attacks. Skill 2, like Pecorine's self-heal, often gets cancelled by Stuns and other debuffs (even more so because of her Taunt).\nBecause of her high P.DEF debuff downtime, she's rarely used as the main tank in Clan Battles. (changed a lot in recent times). She is, however, used against bosses with extremely high P.DEF (which Jun's P.DEF won't be strong enough).\nHer AoE push is rare and is a pretty nice asset to have though. Compacts enemy parties really well to make your AoE attacks deadlier.\nThanks to changes like stronger enemies and Rank Bonus, she now has a place in 4th Stage Clan Battles (against Muuba in particular, the purple magic horse). She has a large P.DEF debuff and a Taunt, which protects your attackers from Muuba's attacks.\nHad more bosses that she could perform well against, but this has also changed a bit because of Christmas Jun. There are also physical compositions which use Angel Yori instead of a dedicated tank, so expect Ruka to go in and out of meta depending on new characters.\nHer \u26056 Ascension gives her TP Fill Rate a massive boost. The P.DEF debuff on \u26056 UB now lasts 24s instead of the standard 18s.\nZekkai no Kata does not stack, Ruka can only have 1 at any given time."

Seems to hit most enemies of the same position but doesn't go far enough to hit other positions (eg. hitting only Vanguards but not Midguards and beyond).\nGood against Multitarget bosses considering her impressive loop pattern and self-buffs, every hit on separate targets count so she stacks up buffs very quickly. Note that she has high base P.Critical and TP Fill Rate stats.\nUnique Equipment doesn't boost Skill 1's damage by much but it does increase its AoE and P.ATK buff slightly (buff duration remains the same 12 seconds), and also number of hits to 8."

UB does 5 hits, Skill 1 does 4 hits, Skill 2 does 3 hits and her normal attack does only 1 hit so getting it to 35 stacks for the 2nd time onwards isn't easy (especially with a loop pattern like that and how the stacks are cleared).\nEach Sword Seal stack adds 0.2 to UB's P.ATK damage multiplier and adds 0.125 to Skill 2's P.ATK damage multiplier. With 35 stacks and at \u26055 with UB's self-buff active, UB does 597309 damage, whereas Skill 2 does 353386 damage.\nHer Unique Equipment increases Skill 1's (2nd cast onwards) P.ATK buff duration from 12s to 30s, matching the first usage's duration.

        "Misc. Information": "A 16-year-old member of Twilight Caravan Eriko is also known as the Destroyer. Eriko manages a flower shop and fell in love with Main Character at first sight and believes he is her 'destined one'. However her love is extremely obsessive and aggressive making her the yandere character of the game. Despite her job Eriko has no interest in the beauty of flowers though she does not dislike them as they can be used as ingredients for drugs and are the source of her income. She is called the Destroyer and feared as such because of her occasional side-job as bodyguard for hire and the destruction she causes. Not only that she cooperates with Mitsuki and creates new drugs every now and then. She has openly stated in front of Main Character that she is 'making an aphrodisiac with sincerity' (it's not hard to guess who the aphrodisiac is for) showing how dangerous she is.\n\nDespite that Eriko is the perfect yamato nadeshiko if you put her yandere and violent tendencies aside. She is very polite good with household chores very kind to children and loves Main Character whole-heartedly... This level of perfection is the reason why Nanaka addresses her as 'Eriko-sama' despite Eriko being 2 years younger than her (Eriko is the youngest in the Guild mind you).\n\nReal World Eriko is pretty much the exact same including the perfection. She fell in love with Main Character at first sight quickly identified his online account snatched a valuable jewel away from a notorious group of hooligans in-game and gave it to Main Character as a present and sent them packing when they looked for her for revenge. She is also a master of drugs just like her Astrum counterpart.",
        "Review": "\nA rather lacklustre attacker until you unlock her Unique Equipment. Until you unlock her Unique Equipment (saying it twice because this is important).\nHer UB has slightly lower multipliers than the standard single-attack main attacker's, and her self-buff is pretty weak, with a low usage frequency, making her more suited to a sub-attacker role (which she shared with Hiyori for a while).\nThis all changed with her Unique Equipment, which made her one of the strongest physical attackers for a very long time. She beat out even the likes of Muimi and Kaori with relative ease, showing why she deserves the Destroyer title.\nSkill 1+ has 2 components: a big P.ATK buff which lasts the regular 12s, and a massive P.ATK and P.Critical buff which lasts for only 7.5s. The two are activated at the same time and they all stack, with the latter component ending earlier.\nAs you can see from her data, the numbers far surpass any other ATK buff in the game. Not only that, 400 P.Critical is a massive buff which translates to approximately, a 20% increase in critical proc rates against enemies of the same level (subjected to diminishing returns).\nObviously, you don't want to use her on Auto. She's almost a manual-only character unless the boss is weak enough that you can beat it regardless of her UB timing.  Much less of an issue at \u26056.\nThe current max damage her pre-\u26056 UB can do against an enemy with 0 P.DEF without buffs from others: 830256 (with Critical). She has a 100% chance to do Critical hits when Skill 1+'s Critical buff is active (against an enemy of the same level).\nThe P.ATK buff on her \u26056 UB lasts the entire battle, but the P.Critical Damage boost lasts the standard 18 seconds. All buffs and debuffs only kick in after the UB hits, so you'll need to use UB within 18 seconds to benefit from the increased Critical damage taken debuff.\n\u26056 UB damage with 1 stack of all her buffs/debuff against the same target (assuming all hits proc Critical): 3727444\n\u26056 UB is a 2-part attack with a damage distribution of 25%-25%-25%-25% each. The 2-part mechanics allow her to ignore the 850k soft damage cap in certain content to a certain extent, similarly to other multi-attack characters like Misogi & Mimi & Kyouka.\nWhile her Skill 1+ buff is still very good, her \u26056 upgrade makes her much more Auto-friendly since the UB now gives you massive benefits if you can use it consecutively, so you really want to fire it off as much as possible (her massive TP Fill Rate makes this relatively easy).\nHer P.Critical Damage buff and Critical damage debuff stack, which gets her damage output really high if you're able to use UB in quick succession. Competes with Kaori in terms of role and positioning: Eriko is stronger but also more fragile against physical attacks."

Still quite fragile so she'll probably be quite situational in boss fights.\nValentine Eriko's UB and Skill 1 have large bonus damage multipliers. 4 times of total missing HP for UB, and 2 times of total missing HP for Skill 1.\nSkill 2's HP cost is actually an attack on herself, calculated using P.ATK * 1.5. It is subject to Critical and P.DEF calculations.\nUE1 boosts Skill 1's base damage multipliers and adds to it an innate Critical damage mod (twice the usual Critical damage), and also also boosts the missing HP multipliers from 2 times to 4 times, matching UB's.\nSkill 2+ buffs: 55% of missing HP is added onto the P.ATK buff, 0.5% is added onto the P.Critical buff, and 0.06% is added onto the P.Critical Damage buff. These 3 buffs last 12s, while the invincibility buff lasts for 6s.\nAssuming she had full health prior to using Skill 2+, the buffs she would get are: +45677 P.ATK, +475 P.Critical, and +46% P.Critical Damage. She would have 2323 P.Critical in total, giving her guaranteed Criticals against enemies up to level 360.\nShe has 69968 HP at \u26055 (71291 HP with level limit break). Skill 2+ completely solves her problem with killing herself easily by changing the self-damage to being based on half of her remaining HP instead.\nAssuming she had full health prior to using Skill 2+, UB would do 609145 damage without Critical, or approximately 1778586 damage with Critical.\nAssuming she had full health prior to using Skill 2+, Skill 1+ would do 374385 damage without Critical, or approximately 2186264 damage with Critical (thanks to the innate 4x Critical damage).\nThe numbers above may look overkill, but remember, the upcoming 02/15 update will raise damage caps.\nSkill 2+ should completely fill her TP gauge thanks to the self-damage, but it has one glaring problem: the self-damage kicks in first, a full 1.3s before Eriko receives the buffs. Expect to see her cancelling the buffs a lot if you play on Instant UB (a.k.a. SET).\nTimeline: 0s (+90 TP from action taken) \u2192 0.7s (+250 TP from self-damage and invincibility buff) \u2192 2.0s (buffs) \u2192 2.1s (+500 TP from TP recovery). These numbers are prior to factoring in TP Fill Rate; with TP Fill Rate, she gains 544 TP before she even gets the buffs.",

With enough buffs from other supports, the duration can last long enough to give Eriko multiple stacks.\nDespite her UB's mechanics, she performs more like a sub-attacker with reliable P.DEF debuffs as her base P.Critical stats is below average (as with all axe characters) so her Critical isn't very reliable even with multiple stacks of her P.Critical buff.\nAs both debuffs last just 12 seconds, there is hardly any double-stacking of the debuffs after her initial loop since she uses Skill 2 just once every 7 actions in her loop. However, she will keep the enemy constantly debuffed.\nStrong on paper, but seems kind of iffy in practice (especially considering she's a limited character). Might want to hold out for a something like Summer Makoto rerun unless you really like her or desperately need P.DEF debuffers.\nCan be very useful for consecutive battles in Clan Battles with very strong initial debuffs (-467 P.DEF), but unless you play in a hardcore Guild and specialise in dealing with leftovers, you probably can make do with alternatives like Ranger Rin.\nUnique Equipment boosts the damage and debuff and adds on an average self-buff, but more importantly, it increases the duration of the debuff to 18 seconds (the self-buff lasts 18 seconds too)."

        "Misc. Information": "A 27-year-old member of Twilight Caravan Mitsuki is also known as the One-eyed Devil. She is a doctor who spends her time developing new drugs but is also a back-alley doctor. She earned her nickname from performing experiments on criminals that Twilight Caravan occasionally catches as well as her defeating of people who obstruct her experiments; villains tremble in fear from the mentioning of the nickname alone. It is said that hell arises when her left eye usually kept under an eyepatch opens. The Mad Scientist of the game who even tries to use Main Character as her guinea pig. She interacts with Eriko the most among the Guild members as they share an interest in the development of new drugs.\n\nMitsuki in the Real World is a scientist specialising in botany neurology (both brain and nerve research) and psychology and had been involved with the development of mimi (the device used to play Legend of Astrum not the character Mimi). She is currently doing researching about roses. She also gets Main Character to touch her for research purposes as she believes his ability as the Princess Knight has something to do with physical contact. Mitsuki also yearns to get married and is desperate enough to want the Main Character as her groom (despite the age gap).",
        "Review": "\nMitsuki is used almost exclusively for Skill 2, a P.DEF debuff. She has however fallen into obscurity as of late, with the increase in powerful debuffers.\nSkill 2's rather odd description is likely because her Field is placed further than most other AoEs, targeting Midguards instead of Vanguards. Enemy Vanguards tend to be outside this Field.\nThe P.DEF debuff itself is very good, but it has a short duration of only 8s. On top of that, she uses Skill 2 only once every 5 attacks, giving it very low uptime (slightly under 50% uptime). This is the reason why she's no longer used in boss battles unless you have no better choices.\nShe is however, still pretty useful for Arena in offensive setups. Her Field has a pretty small AoE (despite its looks) so you'll need the likes of Rima and characters with pushing mechanics (eg. Ninon, Ruka) to force Vanguards and Rearguards into it.\nShe heals herself for 20% of her max HP for every enemy she defeats with her UB. It's as good as non-existent though, since her UB isn't very damaging and has relatively small AoE, so the chances that she gets to defeat enemies with it are rather low.\nHer Unique Equipment is very meh (which looks pretty sad when compared to Eriko's, since they were implemented at the same time). Don't bother unless you use her a lot, and even if you do, just leave it at level 30 and move on with others.\nHer \u26056 turns her UB into an attack that hits all enemies and also applies a P.DEF debuff. Simple but effective upgrade. It also applies the debuff before it hits, making her effective in Arena as a debuffer and attacker in one.\nHer \u26056 UB still has pretty weak damage so it probably won't be used much outside of Arena, except as a backup AoE debuffer for when you can no longer use Creditta due to unit restrictions."

This is especially powerful against enemies that use AoE Skills like Muimi and Tomo, but not very effective against enemies that use AoE UBs instead, as UBs won't activate while Charmed.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 a minor damage boost, as well as powerful debuffs which vary according to whether the enemies hit were afflicted with Charm beforehand. This makes her slightly better at defensive Arena.\nSkill 1+'s AoE is still very small though, so there are still much better choices for defensive Arena (Tsumugi, Aoi and Ayumi in particular).\nHer \u26056 UB has a damage multiplier that is slightly over twice as powerful as before, a slightly longer Charm (5s compared to 4s pre-\u26056), as well as minor TP-related debuffs. Together with her Unique Equipment, she turns into one of the best defensive Arena characters.\nOften used for offensive Arena too, ever since her \u26056 upgrade.

One of the stronger healers in the game, but doesn't do much else (other than a meagre M.DEF debuff) so she doesn't see a lot of use.\nHer single-target heal isn't bad either. At \u26053 level 310 with her EX Skill and Heal Boost stat factored, it heals for 41464 HP even with just 1 enemy hit. Her UB heals for 44843.\nUE1 brings very minor changes to Skill 1, giving it only multiplier boosts and no new mechanics. It's an impressive heal but if you get her UE1, you're doing it more for the Heal Boost stat on it.\nSkill 2+ gains a small AoE boost (900 to 1100) and gives self-buffs that last the entire battle. \nSkill 2+'s damage and M.DEF debuff now go up with the number of enemies in the AoE, just like Skill 1+.\nAt \u26055 (UE1 and UE2 maxed, one stack of Skill 2+ buff), it does 94616 | 102581 | 110547 | 118512 | 126477 damage.\nIt lowers enemies' M.DEF by 206 | 224 | 243 | 262 | 280.

Very powerful against certain high-difficulty bosses as she can effectively seal their UB."

        "Misc. Information": "An 11-year-old student and member of Lucent Academy. Misaki admires adults and wants to be treated as an adult lady. Ironically her growth rate is more worrying than even a certain 10-year-old whose looks and behaviour is more of a 7-year-old's being just 120cm tall. She likes to read fashion magazines and collect cosmetic products because she thinks they'll make her more lady-like. She is however a child at heart enjoying playing just like kids her age do. She envies Io and Suzuna's attractive figures.\n\nHer academic results are disastrous but in order to save the school she has recently started to study hard alongside Suzuna and Main Character. She is able to solve calculation questions that Main Character cannot solve though proving that she's not actually stupid. Then again Main Character lost his memories and is like a baby in a 17-year-old's body so I'm not sure if that's a fair comparison.\n\nShe carries a staff with an eyeball-like monster on it which she affectionately calls 'Eye-chan' and treats it like a pet of some sort. However she treats it very roughly when it comes to battles throwing it around slamming it on the floor. She also uses it as her guinea pig for makeup practice.\n\n'Lady no Tashinami' (\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3\u306e\u305f\u3057\u306a\u307f)... 'Makings of a lady' or something along those lines. 'Tashinami' (\u55dc\u307f) itself has several different meanings and is hard to translate to English. It can mean a taste (preference) hobby an acquired skill an attitude etc. Usually used to present an admirable quality. It's referring to Misaki having the qualities of a lady so to pack it all into one word I guess 'makings' would be close enough.\n\nHas a Summer version with actual assets already made (110201) but was never made playable which some players have joked/theorised that her Summer design failed to pass app stores' checks.",
        "Review": "\nDebuffer that also performs well as an AoE DoT attacker in Arena at \u26056.\nAction Speed buffs and debuffs overwrite each other (i.e. they won't stack and can remove each other). Misaki's Dark Photon is slightly slower than Monica's Fl\u00fcgel Yell, overwriting it immediately after Monica applies the buff...\nHer \u26056 UB now carries a Curse DoT like her Halloween version. It also applies the new Hex debuff found on Ooedo Mitsuki (albeit weaker). Note that like Ooedo Mitsuki, Curse and Hex can co-exist. Both debuffs will apply even if enemies take 0 damage via Barriers.\nSlightly confusing but Misaki's \u26056 UB applies Hex by default, but switches to Curse if the target already has Hex. Ooedo Mitsuki does the opposite, applying Curse by default and adds on Hex if targets were already Cursed. Curse and Hex can stack.\nHex's damage increases by 30% of its base value every second and lasts 18.5 seconds: 1866 \u2192 2425 \u2192 2984 \u2192 3543 \u2192 4102 \u2192 4661 \u2192 5220 \u2192 5779 \u2192 6338 \u2192 6897 \u2192 7456 \u2192 8015 \u2192 8574 \u2192 9133 \u2192 9692 \u2192 10251 \u2192 10810 \u2192 11369 (119115 damage in total)\nHer \u26056 UB also afflicts enemies with Charm for 5s if they're already afflicted with either Curse or Hex.\nSomething interesting to note is that she has very high base Critical stats, at 2439 when fully maxed out (without Level Limit Break). This gives her guaranteed Critical hits against non-bot enemies in Arena, even if they are 10 levels above you with Level limit Break."

This particular combo is nicknamed the 'HalloMisa Cannon'. Currently even more powerful than before with regular Misaki's Unique Equipment implemented (i.e. using both Misaki's).\nSkill 2+'s buffs still last 12s and the AoE is still the same as before.

With certain setups (New Year Neneka, School Festival Yuni, Karin, Maho, etc), she turns into a top-tier buffer.\nAll her Skills have a 100 AoE so they apply only to Rearguards for the most part.\nDue to the speed and potency of Skill 2, she's seen as a counter to Magical Kasumi in Arena as she can completely negate the latter's Skill 2 (it won't stop her UB though, since the TP disrupt from it procs whether it does damage or not).\nWas already a powerful buffer but has become even more prominent with Ameth's appearance since they synergise with one another.\nHer Unique Equipment adds a small M.Critical Damage buff onto Skill 1 (same AoE as all her buffs). This buff lasts the standard 12s. The rest of the buff remains the same, likely because she was already broken before she got her Unique Equipment."

        "Misc. Information": "A 17-year-old student and member of Lucent Academy. Suzuna is a bright and upbeat girl who speaks in gyarugo (gyaru lingo). She's also a charisma model and is quickly gaining popularity. Despite her popularity and status she does not get arrogant about it and remains a very friendly and easy-going girl. She sees Misaki as her best friend and looks up to Nozomi the top idol (Nozomi also looks up to her so they show mutual respect for each other).\n\nSuzuna's academic results and abilities are both catastrophic to the point that she can't still memorise the multiplication table and addresses Main Character as 'Hidesai' (which is a misreading of \u79c0\u624d 'shuusai' which means 'talent' or 'talented person') despite Main Character losing his memories and is essentially a baby in a 17-year-old's body (although he does learn fast so she's not exactly wrong kanji reading aside). But Suzuna is a good girl. (*'\u25bd')\n\nSuzuna is also a charisma model in the Real World and works for a teenager-fashion magazine called Ageage. She is also equally as bad at her studies. She has less time to enjoy her days as a high school student ever since she started working as a model and as such truly enjoys the time she spends with Main Character.\n\n\u203bA charisma model is another word for 'dokusha model' (\u8aad\u8005\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb literally 'reader model' often abbreviated as 'dokumo') amateur fashion models who are picked from the general public (of course looks matter) to pose for fashion magazines. Many of them get more famous than even professional models eventually getting signed on as in-house models for big brands. A few examples of famous dokumo are Rola and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.\n\n\u30fb'Okopun' (\u304a\u3053\u3077\u3093) is a gyaru lingo that is short for 'gekiokopunpunmaru' (\u6fc0\u304a\u3053\u3077\u3093\u3077\u3093\u4e38) which is derived from another more basic gyaru lingo 'oko' (\u304a\u3053). 'Oko' is short for \u6012\u308b (okoru) which means 'to get angry'. '\u6fc0' means 'intense'. \u3077\u3093\u3077\u3093 (punpun) is a Japanese onomatopoeia for someone puffing up their cheeks when getting angry (it can also mean some smell being rather strong but that's not the case here). \u4e38 (maru) means 'round' 'circle' etc and is often added to the end of names. Put it together and it basically means 'I am super angry' in a cutesy manner.\n\n\u30fb'Monikawa' (\u3082\u306b\u30ab\u30ef) is Suzuna's unique gyaru lingo. I've never seen anyone using this so it's likely something she made up herself and she uses it to describe anything she finds cute. 'Kawa' as you may have guessed is short for 'kawaii' ('cute'). 'Moni' has no meaning in particular. Djeeta's classmate in the Real World also used 'monikawa' to describe Djeeta so presumably Suzuna's usage gave it some popularity over there as well.\n\nSuzuna's academic results and capabilities are basically a play on the stereotype of gyaru being stupid. The reason behind her misreading of 'shuusai' is because she saw a quiz variety show on TV and Toyotomi Hideyoshi's (\u8c4a\u81e3\u79c0\u5409) name happened to pop up so she remembered \u79c0 = 'hide'... So yes Suzuna is silly. But Suzuna is a good girl. (*'\u25bd')",
        "Review": "\nA powerful attacker who's comparable to Shiori when the game started, but she has gradually fell off the meta as her Skills don't scale off as well. Still a very decent attacker, just not your first choice attackers.\nHer damage Skills have guaranteed Critical hits, but have low damage multipliers in exchange (she was the original guaranteed-Critical character before Christina came out). This does mean her damage output is very consistent though.\nHer Unique Equipment brings a big change to Skill 1. Look at the damage calculations (assuming enemy has 0 P.DEF, including her self-buff and EX Skill) below to get a better look at the damage potential.\nSkill 1: 107619 physical damage at level 310 \u26055. This is including the critical damage.\nSkill 1+: 238320 physical damage at level 310 \u26055. This is assuming only the first hit is a Critical and the other two are not, so it can go even higher, doing either 318252 or 394452 physical damage.\nSkill 1+ with \u26056 UB self-buff: 298544 physical damage at level 310 \u26056. This is assuming only the first hit is a Critical and the other two are not, so it can go even higher, doing either 413817 or 525359 physical damage.\nAs you can see, she has a ton of potential with Skill 1... though getting the Critical hits on the remaining two hits is the challenge here with her below-average Critical stats, even moreso when her Unique Equipment doesn't give a P.Critical boost.\nWhile the focus has been on Skill 1+, her Unique Equipment gives a massive TP Fill Rate boost too (giving Suzuna one of the highest TP Fill Rate stats in the game), so get it fully maxed if you use her a lot.\nHer \u26056 UB gives herself a P.Critical Damage boost that lasts for 18s. It kicks in before the UB hits the enemy so it will always benefit from it. Since her Skill 1+ also has a guaranteed Critical hit component, this buff gives her a larger overall damage boost than on paper.\nUB does an average of 1369412 damage (factoring in critical rates) against an enemy of the same level (assuming 0 P.DEF). Her below-average P.Critical is a little disappointing but it still does pretty respectable damage on overall with the guaranteed Critical hit.\n\u26056 Suzuna does very similar damage output on overall as her Summer counterpart (with maxed Unique Equipment), but is a lot less situational so she can be used in most content.\nThe self-buffs on Skill 2+ last the entire battle!"

She transforms into a powerful Critical attacker only after she uses it, so she's strictly meant for long-term battles where you can fight the full 90 seconds.\nSummer Suzuna uses Skill 2 approximately when there are 53 seconds remaining (37 seconds into the battle). She benefits from an Action Speed buff greatly (using it 6 seconds earlier if post-Unique Equipment Monica is in the party).\nNote that the P.ATK buff on Skill 2 lasts for the entire battle. This, combined with the frequency of Skill 1, makes her rather powerful before you even factor in her UB.\nSkill 1+ gets a self-buff and guaranteed-Critical. She uses Skill 1 so often that the buff has 100% uptime and can stack (with the aid of Action Speed buffs, and moreso with Skill 2+'s loop pattern change).\nAt \u26055 level 310, Skill 1+ does 272742 damage to the nearest enemy with her self-buff factored in (or 290238 with double buff stacks), making her a very powerful attacker even before Skill 2 kicks in. This damage goes up to 317526 after she uses Skill 2.\nLike the P.ATK buff, Skill 2+'s P.Critical Damage buff lasts the entire battle too. It also changes her loop pattern and completely removes normal attacks from it, while making it possible for her to use Skill 2+ again."

Suzuna's Charm lasts only 5 seconds so you might need another character with a Charm debuff (eg.

Do note that Skill 2 has the slowest projectile in the game, moving very slowly across the field.\nNot a very good character even for Arena use, to be honest. She's also not limited so just save up your Jewels and hope she pops up while you pull for some other limited character.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 an innate Critical damage modifier and boosts the damage tremendously if the target was under Charm. It also applies Charm, though it lasts only 5s so you still want to pair her with someone with Charm if you want the Charm triggers."

        "Misc. Information": "Wei\u00dfe Fl\u00fcgel Landsol Branch's 17-year-old Guild Master. Monica Wei\u00dfwind (stylised as 'Monica Weisswind') is the member of Wei\u00dfe Fl\u00fcgel a military unit in another country and was sent here to spy on Landsol. Unfortunately she looks like a 10-year-old child despite her age (self-claimed 140cm tall but it turned out that she rounded it up from 138cm) so no Guild would accept her and she had no choice but to create her own Guild and she invited Kuuka Ninon and Yuki as they simply happened to be there by complete coincidence. Monica thought she was lucky for being able to quickly create a Guild with great balance (she thought Ninon = Warrior Kuuka = Dancer and Yuki = Healer) but the truth is... Anyway someone should tell Monica that Guild name is probably a bad idea if she's here to spy... (it doesn't seem like she remembers her original mission anyway)\n\nMonica is the only one who has actual combat experience and is actually competent so she is often troubled over the leading of a rather... odd bunch of suspicious individuals and the Guild's lack of achievements but at the same time is also respected by the members as the leader.\n\nWei\u00dfe Fl\u00fcgel means 'White Wings' in German. Her EX Skill 'Hakuyoku no Kago' (\u767d\u7ffc\u306e\u52a0\u8b77) translates to 'Protection/Blessing of the White Wings'.\nHer \u26056 UB's name is taken from her GRANBLUE FANTASY counterpart. Limited Monica in GBF has an Ougi with the exact same name (\u65cb\u98a8\u96f7\u9583\u6483\u9396\u65ac) which roughly means 'Whirlwind Thunderflash Chain Slash'.\n\nMonica despite her constant claims that she's not a child has some child-like hobbies. She likes to visit dagashi stores (\u99c4\u83d3\u5b50\u5c4b traditional stores which sell cheap Japanese snacks) in the Real World (note the 3 Little Lyrical members in the background) while her hobby is 'upgraded' to 'visiting confectionery stores' in Re:Dive (probably because Re:Dive's world has no knowledge of Japan) which makes her somewhat more adult-like... I guess?\n\nWhile she originated from Shingeki no Bahamut (Rage of Bahamut) and was treated as a collaboration character in the first PRINCESS CONNECT! game her Re:Dive counterpart is promoted to being part of the main cast and is no longer treated like a collaboration character (unlike Djeeta and Arisa). Longtime players of Cygames games may have already noticed that Monica looks vastly different in every different game she appears in which led to players joking that she has the ability to travel to other dimensions (one of her cards in Bahamut is named 'Time Leap Monica' too). Note that her name is sometimes spelt as 'Monika' Cygames doesn't really stick to one spelling.",
        "Review": "\nAction Speed buffer specialising in short-term battles, which usually means Arena. Monica was one of the most prominent offensive Arena character early in the game, but fell off quick.\nSkill 1 gives negligible P.ATK and M.ATK buffs, as well as a somewhat powerful 50% Action Speed boost to all allies. 50% Action Speed boost equates to an approximate 33.3% reduction in idle time in between actions.\nShe uses Skill 1 only once at the start of the battle. It lasts 20 seconds.\nAs her loop pattern consists of only 3 actions, she uses Skill 2 often, making it surprisingly effective in Arena if the enemy lineup allows for it.\nAction Speed debuffers are her nemesis, as Action Speed buffs and debuffs overwrite each other. Specifically, Mitsuki, Tsumugi and Misaki. The latter, in particular, removes her buff almost as soon as she applies it, quickly turning Monica into a weak AoE attacker.\nHer Unique Equipment gives a big boost to all her buffs. Her Action Speed boost is now a 100% boost (equating to a 50% reduction in idle time). The duration unfortunately, remains the same at 20 seconds.\nHer \u26056 UB fixes her major problem with Skill 1's buff durations by giving your party equally powerful buffs that last a whopping 30 seconds. Its damage is still terrible though, solidifying her position as a buffer.\nRecent changes to the meta (the addition of Karin, etc) elevated her to top-tier buffer. Her Action Speed buff can often increase damage output more than even powerful ATK or Critical Damage buffers."

        "Review": "\nAll-around physical support that does several jobs at once.\nHer AoE buff lasts for 18 seconds instead of the standard 12 seconds, and 20% of her own P.ATK is added on top of the buff. At \u26055, it should give a 11761 P.ATK buff in total (factoring in base buff).\nHer buff seems pretty decent upon first sight, but it has a very small AoE and won't reach most Vanguards (Christina seems to be the only Vanguard that is within its AoE) so she's more of a buffer for a Midguard and/or Rearguard-centric physical party.\n2% of Skill 2's damage is added on to the amount healed. As Skill 2 itself has fairly low damage multipliers, don't expect this to add up to a lot even with buffs and debuffs factored in.\nAt \u26055, Skill 2 heals for around 23871 HP with her Heal Boost stat factored, assuming her buff is active, the enemy has 0 P.DEF and Skill 2 doesn't proc a critical hit.\nWill be particularly useful against powerful enemies with attacks that target characters based on distance from itself instead of from the nearest target (i.e. might not hit anything at all if there are no Vanguards), but outside of that there are generally better alternatives.\nSkill 1+'s AoE still remains the same but the bonus from Monica's P.ATK now gets a small 1.75% bonus for each ally within its AoE (added to the base 20%). It was pretty lacklustre when implemented, but change in meta turned it into a powerful upgrade.\nAs her buff lasts 18 seconds, with the aid of Action Speed buffers, her buff can snowball quite easily. For example, she has 47141 P.ATK at \u26055. The first buff (assuming 4 characters buffed) will give 15061 P.ATK, but the second buff will give 19128 P.ATK. Add more P.ATK buffers and this number will jump tremendously. There has been a steady increase in number of powerful Midguard/Rearguard buffers like \u26056 regular Monica, Karin and Yuni (School Festival), so unlocking her Unique Equipment has become a priority.\nProbably one of the characters you want to keep a lookout for, as a change in meta could turn her into a top-tier buffer. Notably, players are hoping we get a physical version of New Year Neneka, which could allow them to snowball off each other."

The P.DEF and TP Regen buffs though are separate unconditional buffs, so they don't get dispelled even if Monica gets hit 3 times (or if she cancels it with UB).\nYes, they mean it when they say the channelling lasts until she gets hit 3 times. This means using hits that do 0 damage (via Barriers) will still count as a hit. An attack that does 3 hits or more will also stop it instantly.\nHer attack pattern pauses while she's channelling so she can't do other attacks. Cygames seemed to have designed her for short battles (like overflow battles in Clan Battle) in mind since she'll likely use Skill 1 just once before she transits to Skill 2 for the massive buffs.\nYou can still manually UB (or via Instant-UB enabled), but doing that while she's channelling will also immediately end it. Might be useful if you're looking at her solely as a P.DEF debuffer + buffer.\nSkill 1+'s existing debuff is still the same as before, lasting just 12s.

Monica's first instruction to her was to 'stay in the rearline and support' but Kuuka dashed all the way to the frontlines almost immediately...\n\n\u30fb'Nerau nara Kuuka wo!'

        "Review": "\nIf Miyako is the anti-physical tank of the game, Kuuka is the anti-magical tank of the game. The pair are the twin walls of the game and were often used together in defensive Arena.\nKuuka's Skills are well, quite self-explanatory and straightforward. Her Taunt has very high uptime (nearly 100% uptime with current max level), making it very reliable.\nShe stands right behind Miyako, making them a good combo for defensive Arena as it usually forces your opponents to use a mixed party with both physical and magical attackers if they want to get past you.\nHer P.DEF is quite decent for an anti-magical tank (unlike Miyako, who is paper-thin against magic). Very competent in normal quests, but not enough for her to last in Arena these days (even magical attackers like Neneka give her problems).\nHer Unique Equipment made her even tankier than before, boosting her P.DEF buff and also giving her another self-heal. On top of that, her Unique Equipment has massive Heal Boost stat that is on par with Yukari's, making her self-heals even more powerful than before.\nHer \u26056 UB slightly boosts the existing Barrier's potency and adds on a new damage cut buff that lowers all magical damage she takes by 25%. Seems overkill, but there have been bosses as of late that do so much damage that this level of tankiness is almost required."

        "Misc. Information": "Kuuka's Ooedo version. Kuuka wears a rental kimono making her look like a cute oiran. As usual her perverted delusions and statements put all of that to waste.\nSee below for a video of the mini-game that was available to play during the Shogun Douchuuki Hakuyoku no Samurai event (which features Kuuka and Ninon as the main characters) featuring Ooedo Kuuka.\n\n'Ooedo' (\u30aa\u30fc\u30a8\u30c9 or \u5927\u6c5f\u6238) means 'Great Edo' used to show how prospering Edo city was in the past. Edo was Tokyo's old name used from 1603 to 1867 when Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigned and returned authority to the Meiji emperor.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Iw_u5ElHk\n\u30fb'Koukotsu zecchou no mai~!' (\u604d\u60da\u7d76\u9802\u306e\u821e\uff5e\uff01)... 'Koukotsu' (\u604d\u60da) is used to describe a state of being mesmerised by something or delirious or both (it is also euphemism for describing someone as being 'senile'). 'Zecchou' (\u7d76\u9802) can mean climax of a mountain but usually used to refer to sexual orgasm/climax. 'no mai' just means 'Dance of'. What happens if you combine the them...? Dance of Mesmerising Climax... I don't recommend searching for \u604d\u60da\u7d76\u9802 because it'll return heavy-NSFW results (unless you're interested of course).\n\n\u30fb'Minna takaburimasu yo~!' (\u307f\u3093\u306a\u6602\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3088\uff5e\uff01)... 'Let's get high everyone~!'. \u6602\u308b (takaburu) is used to describe an emotion getting... higher. I don't think there's a way to explain this in English but in Japanese we can actually describe a emotion as rising quite literally. Usually used for positive emotions (eg. excitement happiness morale touched etc). Considering the oiran theme you can probably guess this can have double meanings; rising morales and also getting excited.\n\n\u30fb'Ayashii momoiro toiki desu~!' (\u5996\u3057\u3044\u6843\u8272\u5410\u606f\u3067\u3059\uff5e\uff01)... 'Momoiro Toiki' (\u6843\u8272\u5410\u606f) literally means 'pink breath' and is actually the title of a song in the 1980s which is actually an altered form of 'Aoiki toiki' (\u9752\u606f\u5410\u606f literally 'blue breath sigh') an idiom which means someone is in pain/suffering. The modified version is up to one's imaginations but is usually interpreted as a woman in love or yearning for a man. 'Ayashii' (\u5996\u3057\u3044) means something mysterious and bewitching.\n\n\u30fb'Kenran Trip Zone' (\u7d62\u721b\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30be\u30fc\u30f3)... 'Kenran' (\u7d62\u721b) describes something extremely beautiful to the point it can be dazzling. 'Trip zone' is well... just Kuuka getting high on her delusions as usual. You know tripping...\n\nNo one actually knows how the \u8276\u693f in her UEs is supposed to be pronounced; a player asked Cygames but they refused to answer. It's either 'adetsubaki' or 'tsuyatsubaki' (entries for both exist on the internet); I opted for the former.",
        "Review": "\nThe first magical Vanguard, as well as the first tank that uses magical attacks. Kuuka drops her Taunt for offensive utilities that help a magical party.\nNot nearly as bulky as regular Kuuka, but she does have a UB that will pretty much heal herself to full HP.\nHer P.DEF and M.DEF buff's AoE is extremely small, reaching only a few Vanguards at the most (ranging from Rima to Christmas Ayane). For most parts, you can think of it as a self-buff, although notably, it reaches Christmas Ilya as well.\nPosition-wise, she has some potential in Clan Battle as she can tank for Ilya and Anna, whereas Akari can't. However, if the boss carries powerful AoE attacks that absolutely require defense buffs, the likes of Kurumi or New Year Yui would be a better choice.\nMight be much more usable in boss fights with her Unique Equipment making her a potent buffer, but the major problem of her UB buff's ridiculously small AoE is still there so don't expect too much out of her. She does have a rare M.Critical buff but it's still a rather meagre one.\nThe buffs and debuff on Skill 2+ last 18s."

Kinda a mix-and-match of regular Kuuka and Ooedo Kuuka, but on steroids.\nWhile her Heal Boost stat is a little low, her self-heal has massive multipliers (higher than regular Kuuka's UB). With the Heal Boost stat factored, it heals Kuuka for 58717 HP at \u26053 (61897 HP at \u26055).\nTanky enough to tank even hits from Goblin Great (4th step onwards), previously done so with mostly characters with evasion gimmicks like Christmas Saren and Christina.\nPretty much an upgrade over Ooedo Kuuka in every way. Unless the on-demand UB self-heal on Ooedo Kuuka is absolutely crucial, Noir Kuuka will probably be the much better pick.\nHer Unique Equipment adds on pretty large chunk of HP. Skill 1+'s Barrier is now an absorption Barrier instead of a nullifying one and she also gains a powerful Regen (6 ticks), so she becomes far tankier than before.\nSkill 1+ gains slight improvements to the already good M.ATK and M.Critical buffs, as well as gaining a 10% M.Critical Damage buff, boosting her role as a buffer as well."

        "Misc. Information": "A 16-year-old member of Wei\u00dfe Fl\u00fcgel Landsol Branch. Ayumi is a stalker of Main Character's and is the last member to join the Guild when she was caught stalking Main Character. Monica scouted her for her potential in her 'Stalking Skill' while Ninon mistook her for a kunoichi (female ninja) due to her ability to hide her presence completely. Originally an innocuous and timid girl whose mother told to get a part-time job and earn her own keep Ayumi was saved by a 'senior' (Main Character) at her workplace from a drunkard trying to hit on her on her first day of work. She rather quickly developed a crush on him but later found out that the 'senior' was actually a last-minute helper who worked for only that one day... and her stalking started. Main Character didn't even know her until the members of Wei\u00dfe Fl\u00fcgel Landsol Branch caught her. Her level of stalking is so high that she was able to happily describe Main Character's actions for a couple of days in detail when questioned by Makoto and Kasumi during Kasumi's event (and slightly creeping Makoto and Kasumi out).\n\nAyumi was originally an unnamed high-school girl in PRINCESS CONNECT! (i.e. the previous game) who appeared in several characters' stories and was unimportant to the plot but the developers later promoted her to a named and playable character (Ishibashi Ayumi) right before they announced that the game will be ending its service (though it seemed to have been planned beforehand that they would be making a sequel to the game as Re:Dive was announced barely a month after PRINCESS CONNECT! ended). Funnily enough she was also voiced by Oozeki (who also voices Minerva) back even when she was an unnamed character (see Oozeki's tweet below):\nhttps://twitter.com/zekieri818/status/748722007143919616\n\u30fb'Yuuki wo dashite totsugeki desu~!'

        "Review": "\nUpon first looks, she seems like a pretty weak character, but is actually a powerful defensive Arena character (one of the best, even, although the likes of \u26056 Rino and \u26056 Io made her slightly irrelevant).\nShe's primarily a debuffer, but her Skills are all AoE and her P.DEF is high, making her somewhat of an Arena attacker as well, since she can tank enemy attacks and repeatedly UB.\nSkill 2 and UB's AoE are very big, at 1200. She can often hit even Rearguards.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 a minor damage and debuff boost, as well as increasing its AoE and it's a lot better now. Definitely get it if you use Ayumi for your defensive Arena party (max it, even, since it gives massive defense bonuses).\nHer \u26056 UB gets a big upgrade, with much higher damage, Darkness and Confusion both lasting twice as long (12s and 8s respectively), and has a massive TP Fill Rate debuff. The AoE however, remains the same (it's already one of the bigger AoEs anyway).\n\u26056 UB damage,1st UB: 111677 | 2nd UB: 142258 | 3rd UB: 172839 | 4th UB onwards: 203420"

Stealth lasts 12 seconds, but gets dispelled if she gets hit by an AoE attack.\nSkill 2 seems to be pretty slow and shares the same problem with Skills that target the furthest enemy: the first cast will go to Rima and New Year Muimi because they start out as the furthest enemy.\nShe teleports to the target when using Skill 1, which allows her to escape attacks for a short period. Stealth kicks in as soon as she starts the skill so attacks that target the nearest enemy won't target her even if she's right next to the target.\nUnique Equipment boosts Skill 1's P.ATK buff potency as well as massively boosting its damage (5.42x of its old multipliers), allowing it to take out fragile targets in Arena. It also gains the same 0 TP via damage taken property as Overload Kyaru's UB.\nWhile her Unique Equipment now gives her a clear role in Arena, it still doesn't fix her biggest problem: she starts the battle with Skill 2, not Skill 1+."

Ninon Joubert is an energetic girl and also the typical Japanophile (or 'Land of the East' maniac since there's no 'Japan' in Astrum) foreigner who speaks in somewhat broken Japanese. While she loves the Japanese culture and is very knowledgeable about it her knowledge about it is also often slightly off in weird ways. For example while she intended to portray herself as a ninja (her Ougi even says it's a ninja technique) her outfit and behaviour (calling Main Character her 'Shogun' her favourite book is 'BUSHIDO' she often speaks of her goal being 'the unification of the land') are completely of a samurai's. Meanwhile Monica (also a foreigner) thinks she is a Warrior.\n\nHer Real World counterpart is an international student from France and like her Astrum counterpart is a Japanophile who loves the Sengoku~Edo era. As usual her knowledge about Japan is often off in weird ways. For example she thinks people in Japan cook while wearing an apron naked. She calls Main Character 'Shogun' because he is able to powerup girls using his ability as a Princess Knight.",
        "Review": "\nA good Arena attacker and is also great for regular quests. However, she has fallen off the grid as of recent, due to characters with stupidly huge or powerful AoEs, like Mimi and Summer Kaori (she was previously one of the top Arena attackers).\nHer UB's AoE is wide enough to reach the former half of Midguards. Which is rather wide, if you don't compare her to the likes of Mimi.\nSkill 1 is kind of eh. Average damage, and a rather uninteresting addon effect. Her Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 a damage boost, and a large boost to her TP recovery, but it's a pretty 'meh' change.\nSkill 1+ recovers her TP to full if it manages to defeat an enemy, allowing her to UB immediately. Getting it to defeat anything to begin with is the hard part, so it's quite unfortunate that her Unique Equipment focused on that component instead of its damage.\n\u26056 UB's damage increases massively, and now grants her a P.ATK boost and a TP recovery. Similar to Skill 1+ but the much higher damage makes it a lot easier to make use of the TP boost. Its AoE also increases somewhat.\nThe potency of the P.ATK buff and the TP boost are straight up boosted by 200% per enemy defeated for every enemy Ninon defeats. The 200% is probably a bug though, since the 2.0 in the data is just a counter ID (eg. New Year Shefi's Ice Dragon Fang has 297.0) and doesn't mean that the buff goes up by 200%.\nTP recovered per enemy defeated (inclusive of TP Fill Rate stat),0 enemy: 154 | 1 enemy: 462 | 2 enemies: 770 | 3 enemies: 1078,Note that you need just 1000 TP for a full gauge, so Ninon's high TP Fill Rate really helps here.\nP.ATK boost per enemy defeated,0 enemy: 7464 | 1 enemy: 22392 | 2 enemies: 37320 | 3 enemies: 52248 | 4 enemies: 67176\nStrong in Arena but a pretty average AoE attacker for PvE unless it's a regular 3-wave quest or some boss that regularly summons minions."

Not top-tier like Eriko and Muimi (pre-Unique Equipment, that is), but she has her plus points which makes her a good attacker.\nOoedo Ninon's UB has slightly lower damage multipliers compared to other main attackers', but in return, it does 50% more damage when it procs Critical hits. This innate Critical Damage bonus stacks with Critical Damage buffs multiplicatively.\nWhat makes Ooedo Ninon useful is her loop pattern. She uses Skill 1 every alternate turn, making it possible to stack her debuffs. She may become a top-tier debuffer if her Unique Equipment boosts the debuff. (decent debuffer with Unique Equipment, but not top-tier).\nHer Unique Equipment gives a massive boost to her P.Critical stats, as well as giving Skill 1 a Critical damage modifier, which coupled with her extremely high Skill 1+ usage frequency makes her a much better attacker than before.\nThe P.ATK and P.Critical Damage buffs on Skill 2+ last the entire battle. Her UE2 also gives her a much needed TP Fill Rate boost."

She has a P.ATK EX Skill but that does nothing much for her since Skill 2 has pretty garbage damage multipliers. To balance her out, I guess, since she's a pretty potent buffer despite being a free character.\nUnique Equipment gives Skill 1 a pretty negligible boost. No permanent buffs or anything like that, so it's more for the TP Fill Rate stat on the equipment itself that you want.\nSadly can't be used with School Festival Yuni since her buff only targets physical characters."

A male despite his appearance (this is something neither the game nor Yuki himself bothers hiding so it's not really a spoiler at this point). The ultimate narcissist Yuki is extremely confident of his looks to the point he thinks getting a glimpse of him is a blessing to mankind and he once planned to get a hot air balloon and travel around the world just to let people get a glimpse of him. By far the most uncooperative member in the Guild because he would often look at his mirror even in battle or refuse to take part in battle claiming 'what if my face gets scarred?'. Also his narcissism is so serious that he would turn negative incidents into opportunities to praise his looks (eg. when his mirror shattered after dropping it he looked into the pieces and said the pieces infinitely reflect his cuteness).\n\nThat said Yuki is not gay. He's just so narcissistic that gender in his opinion is of unimportance in front of his beauty. He does feel comfortable being around Main Character though... (mainly because Main Character understands his beauty the best).\n\nReal World Yuki is just as much of a narcissist. His confidence is well placed though seeing as he often gets hit on while walking on the streets (because people think he's a girl). Even Main Character didn't know until they were caught in a rain and Yuki stripped to get a change of clothes.\n\nYuki is pretty much based on the origin of the words 'narcissism' Narcissus of Greek mythology fame. Quoting Wikipedia Once during the summer he was getting thirsty after hunting and the goddess lured him to a pool where he leaned upon the water and saw himself in the bloom of youth. Narcissus did not realize it was merely his own reflection and fell deeply in love with it as if it were somebody else. Unable to leave the allure of his image he eventually realized that his love could not be reciprocated and he melted away from the fire of passion burning inside him eventually turning into a gold and white flower.\n\u30fb'Boku no bi ni hirefusu ga ii!'

The damage will be calculated using Yuki's M.ATK and whichever DEF that is lower on the target (checked individually for each target).\nThe Charm debuff on \u26056 UB lasts for 4 seconds. Because of its damage mechanics, players would have a much easier time landing it even if the enemy has high M.DEF since it'll be treated as physical damage (rendering Stage Misaki's Barrier useless, something the Yukari-Io setup has difficulty accomplishing)."

All other buffs/debuffs last the standard 12s/18s durations.\nAt level 310, UB's M.ATK buff goes up by 248.8 per Beauty stack, resulting in a 21148 boost to M.ATK at 60 stacks (including the base buff).\nSkill 1's M.ATK buff is exactly half of UB's at 124.4 per Beauty stack, resulting in a 10574 boost to M.ATK at 60 stacks (including the base buff).\nUB's M.ATK debuff goes up by 124.4 per Beauty stack, resulting in a 12440 M.ATK debuff at 60 stacks.\nSkill 1's TP recovery goes up by 1 per Beauty stack, resulting in a maximum of 100 TP at 60 stacks (prior to TP Fill Rate boost).\nUB's damage also goes up with Beauty stacks, resulting in it doing 267162 damage at \u26053 (inclusive of EX Skill but not his M.ATK buffs), so he can do some damage as a support (though still low overall damage due to Skill 1 not doing damage).\nAll of his buffs (including the TP recovery) have a small AoE of just 100.\nSkill 1+'s M.ATK bonus from Beauty stacks go up slightly. The M.ATK buff goes up from 124.4 to 155.5 per Beauty stack, resulting in a 12440 boost to M.ATK at 60 stacks.\nThe TP bonus per Beauty stack for Skill 1+ remains the same. The new M.Critical buff also goes up by 1 per Beauty, resulting in a fairly negligible +80 M.Critical buff."

        "Misc. Information": "A 17-year-old member of the St. Theresa Girls Academy (Buddy Club) and a 2nd-year student. Chloe is the typical downer; someone who you would describe as the opposite of 'hyperactive'. Her low voice fierce looks cold attitude caused her to be seen as a delinquent and one of the school's 3 problem children. She met Yuni and Chieru at the briefing for the scholarship grant. \n\nBut contrary to her outside appearance she's actually a kind and attentive girl and those who know her well like the other Buddy Club members describe her as 'cute' and 'shy'. Chieru describes her as 'eldest sister-type and good at looking after others but seems like she would be scary when she's angry' whereas Yuni describes her as 'the cool-type who's actually a cute-type in disguise' making her a tsundere character. She is conscious about her rather short stature at 156cm tall which is 2cm shorter than Chieru her junior. She is unaware that she actually has a small group of fans in school most notably Maria.\n\nShe grew up in the downtown area of Landsol hence her habit of using youngster/gyaru lingo in her speech like 'ataoka' (\u30a2\u30bf\u30aa\u30ab) which is short for 'atama okashii' (\u982d\u304a\u304b\u3057\u3044) referring to someone with 'a screw loose'. She has 3 younger brothers and makes lunchboxes for them which explains why she's good at looking after people. She has slight chuunibyou tendencies; although not as serious as Anna's she shows interest in such topics and you can tell her preferences with her Skill names.\n\n\u30fb'Ankoku no Shokou' (\u95c7\u9ed2\u306e\u66d9\u5149) = 'Dark Dawn'. 'Shokou' can be used both literally as 'dawn' (specifically the gleam of light that peeks through the horizon at dawn) but also can be used idiomatically to refer to a gleam of hope.\n\u30fb'Shikon no Tasogare' (\u7d2b\u7d3a\u306e\u9ec4\u660f) = 'Purple Twilight'. 'Shikon' is specifically very dark purple with a slight bluish tone (dark magenta to be specific).\n\u30fb'Hakugin no Tsukikage' (\u767d\u9280\u306e\u6708\u5f71) = 'Silver Moonlight'. 'Hakugin' is literally 'white-silver' but for most parts is just a fancy term for 'silver' (the colour); it can also be read as 'shirogane' (eg. 'shiroganeiro') but probably not in this case. 'Tsukikage' can refer to both moonlight and the shape of the moon and also can be read as 'getsuei' (the Skill name might very well be 'Hakugin no Getsuei').\n\nAlso she says 'Yonaka no Yoake' (\u591c\u4e2d\u306e\u591c\u660e\u3051) when she uses her UB; it's one of those things that chuunibyou people like to do: having a reading that is different from how it is written. 'Yonaka no Yoake' means 'Midnight Dawn' so it isn't too far from 'Dark Dawn'. This also means like Anna her Skill names very likely have pronunciations different from how they're written.\n\nHer Real World name is Kuroe Hanako (\u9ed2\u6c5f\u82b1\u5b50). It is unique in the sense that she is the first character in the game to use her family name for her in-game name (Kuroe \u2192 Chloe) though it's because she likes the sound of Chloe better and 'Hanako' is seen as a pretty 'lame' and old-fashioned name so modern kids tend to hate it (also because of its association with the folklore 'Hanako of the Toilet'). Note that she's the only Vanguard Elf at the moment (most Elves tend to fight from a distance like magic or archery). Studies in the same school as Rei Tsumugi and Ninon in the Real World. A distant relative of Hatsune and Shiori's too though it's unclear if this association applies to the real world too.",
        "Review": "\nA powerful debuffer and decent attacker, but also a slow starter that takes a lot of time to warm up. Think of her as a weaker version of Summer Suzuna who takes a longer time to charge up, but has a powerful debuff to make up for that.\nShe starts off the battle with Skill 1, which is used just once. It gives her a P.ATK buff that lasts only 12s despite being used only once, but the main component is the trigger for her unique debuff called 'Cowering'.\nSkill 1's descriptions are a little confusing. It basically means Chloe's attacks afflict Cowering on the specific target that she attacked (not 'all enemies', which is a problem with things getting lost in translation and Cygames' weird sentence structure).\nAlso, while it's not mentioned, Chloe afflicts the debuff with 1 Cowering stack per hit, not per attack. UB does 20 hits and Skill 2 does 5 hits. Cowering debuff is applied after an attack is completed, so Skill 2's damage only benefits from the new stacks the next time it is used.\nAs per the descriptions, she needs to land the attacks in order to afflict Cowering stacks. Darkness debuffs are her nemesis.\nWhile it takes time for her to stack up, she turns into one of the better P.DEF debuffers in the game when she gets 66 Cowering stacks on an enemy as she uses Skill 2 with high frequency, enough for it to be up 100% of the time and stack for around half the time.\nHer potential goes up considerably with incoming damage, TP support and Action Speed buffs. Consider pairing her up with the likes of Djeeta and Summer Saren.\nPrior to Unique Equipment:\nCalculation for Skill 2's total debuff (with Cowering stacks): ceiling(number of Cowering stacks * (0.01 + 0.0096 * SLv) + base debuff). The two debuffs are one component so they add up before getting rounded up.\nCurrent max debuff per Skill 2 (with 66 Cowering stacks): 254\nCalculation for Skill 2's total damage (from Cowering stacks): floor((SLv + 1) * 16 + P.ATK * (1.4 + number of Cowering stacks * 0.03)).\nCurrent max damage per Skill 2 (with 66 Cowering stacks and \u26055, without self-buff and criticals): 175442\nShe's definitely powerful, but not to the extents of Summer Makoto. Where and how you use her is crucial, as she hits 66 Cowering stacks much earlier with a boss' incoming damage taken into consideration, so she's not a good candidate if the boss cannot hit her.\nAfter Unique Equipment:\nCalculation for Skill 2's total debuff (with Cowering stacks): no changes to formula itself\nCurrent max debuff per Skill 2 (with 99 Cowering stacks): 352\nCalculation for Skill 2's total damage (from Cowering stacks): no changes to formula itself\nCurrent max damage per Skill 2 (with 99 Cowering stacks and \u26055, with Skill 1+'s perma-buff and without criticals): 271790\nHer Unique Equipment brings simple, but significant upgrades to her kit. Firstly, Skill 1+'s self-buff now lasts the entire battle unless dispelled and is twice as powerful as before. Secondly, the Cowering stack cap has been increased from 66 to 99.\nThe Unique Equipment also gives a big boost to her P.Critical and TP Fill Rate stats (the latter in particular, more than doubles her base TP Fill Rate stat when maxed).\nIn a situation where she can make full use of her now high Critical stats and has Action Speed buffs, she can potentially do similar damage output to the likes of Christina with maxed Unique Equipment, making her a powerful attacker as well.\nUnfortunately, unlike post-Unique Equipment Chieru, her Unique Equipment doesn't give stacks to start with so her biggest weakness (i.e. takes time to get strong) remains the same. You probably don't want to use her against enemies that don't hit for much."

The debuff on Skill 1 lasts 18s instead of the standard 12s, making it a very reliable source of debuff.\nUB does 6 hits, while Skill 2 does 4 hits. As there's no visual indicator for the number of hits done, view the TP burst as an added on bonus to an already strong character (since it might proc when you're already near a full gauge).\nHer Unique Equipment boosts the P.ATK buff slightly and the P.DEF debuff significantly, and also lowers the number of hits required to get the TP burst significantly, down to just 13 hits required, so she does a stupid amount of UB now.\nHer post-Unique Equipment P.DEF debuff is now the 2nd (after Kyaru's Skill 2+) strongest non-UB P.DEF debuff without weird durations or conditions (eg. used only once, target required to have under X% HP, etc), making her a very powerful debuffer at the moment.\nNote that her damage output is quite good for a debuffer, but average at best if you're comparing her to attackers despite the powerful buffs and TP burst, since UB itself has low damage multipliers."

        "Misc. Information": "A 18-year-old member of the St. Theresa Girls Academy (Buddy Club) and a 3rd-year student. Yuni is the leader of the Guild and is one of the most intelligent characters in the game (possibly moreso than some of the Seven Crowns) having a doctorate at her age and people around her address her as 'Professor Yuni' which isn't a nickname but rather a formal address. The best example to this is how she managed to arrive at the conclusion that something about Astrum is off from purely her own studies of the world's language religions history culture etc. In contrast to her intelligence she isn't good with communication and had no friends until she met Chloe and Chieru. Similar to Main Character Yuni seems to have no memories of her past knowing only that she was abandoned as a child and was picked up by a village in the secluded mountain regions that consists of only elderly folks (Yuni jokes that the fact that she's the only young person in the village makes her the 'no.1 beauty in the village').\n\nYuni is also extremely petite for her age being only 142cm tall. Unlike Misaki she doesn't seem to have an inferiority complex about her height and even takes advantage of it occasionally mixing into the group of children at Sarendia Orphanage and calling Saren 'Mama' and assumingly get doted on (note: Saren is 1 year younger than Yuni) and in the mini-drama that came with the character song CD pretended to be a lost 8-year-old and was taken care of by the members of Little Lyrical (and pestering Kyouka for I hope jokingly breast milk). Perhaps because of the way she acts and her looks neither Chloe nor Chieru seem to treat her as a senior and often make sharp retorts at her. Chloe described Yuni as it's as though I got myself a younger sister that acts older than she looks. She does hope to grow though as seen when she said she is on her way to 170cm tall and a three-size of 90-55-90 albeit half-jokingly since she knows that's almost impossible.\n\nOn a side note while it wasn't touched upon by other characters you can tell from various scenes and the ED animation that Yuni is terrible at drawing.\n\n\u30fbNinshiki to Hattensei no Tetsugaku (\u8a8d\u8b58\u3068\u767a\u5c55\u6027\u306e\u54f2\u5b66): 'Philosophy of Recognition and Potential'\n\u30fbGouketsu Seisei Gairon (\u8c6a\u5091\u751f\u6210\u6982\u8ad6): 'Introduction/Overview of the Creation of a Hero'\n\u30fbKanshou Inshi Tankyuu (\u7de9\u885d\u56e0\u5b50\u63a2\u6c42): 'The Pursuit of the Revelle Factor'\n\u30fbSekigaku no Oshie (\u78a9\u5b66\u306e\u6559\u3048): 'The Teachings of a Great Scholar'\n\nYuni carries a massive halberd with a fountain pen tip as her weapon but she doesn't have the strength to swing it. The only reason why she carries it is because she likes how it represents both Arms and Knowledge (via Purikone! Re:Dive no.174). Apparently named Pencilaxe according to her Unique Equipment (the Unique Equipment is a replica that is light enough for her to easily wield).\n\nShizuru's classmate in the Real World.",
        "Review": "\nMagical Rearguard that specialises in buffing the ally with the highest P.ATK and deploying a party-wide Barrier that blocks magical damage.\nYuni is a pure buffer that does almost no damage, but in return, is a very powerful one and possibly one of the most powerful to date, with P.Critical buffs that far exceed any other buffer's (second only to Eriko's self-buff).\nUB buffs last for 18s. Skill 1 and 2's buffs last for 12s. The duration applies to the debuffs she puts on herself too.\nFairly decent in Arena as a buffer + TP battery.\nUnlike Christmas Chika, may have high potential for boss fights too, due to her UB giving a party buff and Skill 2 having a small but nifty TP Regen.\nHer Unique Equipment adds on a powerful P.Critical Damage buff, making her one of the best single-target buffers in the game.\nThe changes to Unique Equipment with TP Fill Rate/Cost Reduction stats past level 260 follows a standard rule (every TP Fill Rate = 5 ATK, every TP Cost Reduction = 8 ATK). Unfortunately in Yuni's case, the M.ATK boost does nothing for her so she just loses out in every way."

        "Review": "\nRearguard buffer that gives both P.ATK and M.ATK buffs and a Critical Damage buff to all allies (except herself). Similar to Karin but Yuni's debuffs and buffs are purely for offense in nature.\nSimilar to Karin, School Festival Yuni replaces normal attacks with a percentage-based buff. This buff is based off base stats (not inclusive of EX Skill). \nLearning Time lasts 18 seconds. UB's additional effects require her to use UB again while Learning Time is active.\nTP gain via damage taken is based on percentage of HP loss, so players might want to avoid levelling her EX Skill. A Yuni with level 1 EX Skill gains approximately 39.2% more TP from damage taken than one with maxed EX Skill at \u26053.,(ignore, see below)\nWhile extremely powerful, note that her Action Speed buff is only 50% and it'll overwrite stronger buffs due to how Action Speed buffs work (especially damaging to \u26056 Monica who recently got a place in meta).\nDo note that while incredibly powerful, she heavily depends on TP and/or Action Speed support from others and/or damage taken, since she herself is excluded from her buffs and she needs to be in Learning Time almost all the time to be worth using.\nIt's unclear if it's a bug, but TP gained via damage taken does NOT take the extra HP from EX Skills into consideration. For now, it's safe to level Yuni's EX Skill (and even beneficial against HP% damage), but I can't guarantee if they'll fix this in the future.\nIn a 2023 February update, Cygames made some big changes to the mechanics for TP gain via damage taken, turning the EX Skill bug into an actual feature so you can now safely level EX Skill as it won't lower your TP gain.\nThe same 2023 February update also made it such that Unique Equipment stats no longer factor into TP gain via damage taken, so feel free to max it out."

        "Review": "\nSimilar to Chloe, Chieru is an attacker with a unique stack-based mechanic, albeit less dependent on it considering the stacks boost only Skill 2's buff component but not the damage component.\nUnfortunately, like Chloe, Skill 1's P.ATK, P.Critical and Action Speed buffs don't last the entire battle despite Chieru using it only once per battle. They last for 20s, while the ability to gain Cheru stacks last for the entire battle.\nSkill 2's buffs and debuffs last for 12s. UB comprises of 10 hits, while Skill 2 has only 1 hit. This makes her UB the only effective way to get to max Cheru as fast as possible.\nEach Cheru stack adds 0.5 to Skill 2's P.ATK's base multiplier. This equates out to a bonus of roughly 155.5 P.ATK buff per stack, or a total of 6531 at max Cheru.\nEach Cheru stack adds 7 to Skill 2's P.Critical buff. This equates to a 245 P.Critical buff with max Cheru, which is an 11.7% increase in Critical rates over Chieru with just the base 35.\nFairly awkward character with no practical use prior to getting her Unique Equipment. Her Unique Equipment brings a big change to Skill 1 and turns her into a Critical machine (see below).\nPre-unique Equipment: She has 1879 P.Critical for the first 20s of the battle. This equates to a 93.95% chance of doing a Critical hit against an enemy of the same level.\nAll of her buffs on Skill 1+ now last the entire battle.\nShe now has at least 2817 P.Critical with maxed UE1 (inclusive of Skill 2 vanilla self-buff), which gives her guaranteed Critical hits against an enemy up to level 436.\nWith Skill 1+, Skill 2 now starts out with a 6531 P.ATK boost and caps out at 13840. This allows her P.ATK to hit 78744 at 77 Cheru stacks.\nWith Skill 1+, Skill 2 now starts out with a 245 P.Critical boost and caps out at 574.\nHer UB at \u26055 and maxed Unique Equipment starts out at 271161 damage, and caps out at 297473 (very small increase despite the large P.ATK due to the multipliers being pretty low). This is prior to Critical calculations."

She seems to have a strong sense of justice as Matsuri thinks she's cool despite their affiliations.\n\nShe has an ability unique to Dragons called 'Awakening'. Due to her personality she easily loses her temper when people close to her gets hurt and Homare said that this is the trigger to her Awakening. In her Awakening form she becomes incredibly powerful even without getting boosted by Main Character but in return loses the capability to think rationally (i.e. 'berserker').\n\nApparently Daikon Daigo's younger sister in the Real World as noted by her mentioning she has a strong older brother and her family name being Kidou (\u9b3c\u9053) the same as Daigo's.",
        "Review": "\nA straightforward attacker that does above-average damage overall, but her first UB usage has extremely high damage multipliers (twice as powerful as other attackers' UBs).\nWhile her damage is pretty average aside from her initial UB, she uses her Skills pretty frequently, leading to higher damage than one would expect.\nShe's the complete opposite to the likes of Summer Suzuna; she's geared for short-term battles. She starts off with very high Skill usage frequencies until her 12th action, which is followed up by normal attacks and a somewhat long delay before she self-buffs again.\nShe does well in scenarios where she is expected to take part in multiple battles. Regular quests aside, she also does decently well in Clan Battles where you know your party will finish off the boss and can carry on to the next boss.\nWhile already kind of average to begin with, Christmas Christina (released right after her) completely overshadows her, being capable of doing the same amount of damage on her UB without the once-per-battle limitation, as well as buffing the party.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 a massive damage boost when used for the first time and also adds on a fairly weak P.DEF debuff and a very powerful P.ATK self-buff. Note that the debuff and buff last for 30s instead of the usual 12s.\nThe P.ATK buff on Skill 1+ kicks in before the hit connects, so it'll do more damage than what the in-game tooltip suggests.\nWithout buffs from other allies, it'll do approximately 523809 damage at \u26055, but note that this number is before defense calculations and the debuff on Skill 1+ kicks in only after the skill hits the enemy so it'll almost never hit for that kind of damage.\nConsidering the buff and debuff's duration, she might be pretty useful when you need to finish off a Clan Battle boss since you can carry her over into the next battle with both lasting 30s.\n\u26056 UB works like Shiori and Misora's Skills; if there's only one enemy, it does both hits on the same target, leading to double the damage. The self-buff lasts for 18s.\n<tentative, will check again when I get her \u26056 (not soon)> P.DEF ignore should work the same as Christina's, except percentage-based.

Like her regular counterpart, her Skills also have above-average damage output compared to other single-target attackers (bar \u26056 characters).\nHer massive Action Speed buff gives her 2 stacks of Skill 2's P.ATK buff at all times (for very short periods, 3 stacks). Note that Action Speed buffs shorten the idle time in between attacks, not speeding up actions themselves; Kaya's Skill 2 has a slightly long animation.\nAction Speed buffs/debuffs do not stack and will overwrite each other regardless of potency, so avoid using her with other supports that can buff their allies' Action Speed. No longer true as of 2024/04/12, feel free to use them as they'll no longer overwrite Kaya's.\nHas a higher UB cycle rate than any other character in the game (beating even Djeeta and Arisa) thanks to her buffs, TP recovery and her naturally high TP Fill Rate as a Fist character. Typically UBs every 6~7 seconds when not taking damage.\nHer UB cycle rate is high enough that you can disregard the Action Speed buff on Skill 2 completely since it'll never proc after you use UB once, unless her UB buffs get dispelled.\nHer Unique Equipment adds an additional attack and a self-buff to Skill 1 if she had an Action Speed buff on her (higher damage than UB in total). This self-buff procs only after the two hits, but lasts a whopping 50 seconds so it can stack up pretty nicely.\nAs mentioned, her Action Speed is hilariously high so her P.ATK (if not dispelled) only continuously goes up and never down even though neither P.ATK buffs on Skill 1+ and 2 are permanent. Testing against the Pirate event boss, she had gained 45405 worth of P.ATK boosts exactly 1 minute into the fight and her Skill 1+ was doing 262996 damage (with Critical) against a target with 210 P.DEF (so it would have done approximately 815287 damage against a target with 0 P.DEF, with Critical hits factored).\nSimilar to the Little Lyrical trio and Summer Kyaru, the additional attack mechanics allows Skill 1+ to ignore the soft damage cap in Dungeon EX V and Clan Battles to a certain extent."

Despite being the youngest Inori has a foul mouth and has a haughty attitude though in reality she's a scaredy cat who just talks big (often getting pressured into doing something she doesn't want to do when faced with Homare smiling silently at her). She claims that she's among the executive members of the Guild but her introduction when she first appeared listed her as an 'underling' who dreams of usurping Homare's position. 'Cheeky brat' would probably be an apt description for her in a likeable way.\n\nCan breathe fire from her mouth and sometimes does it accidentally when sneezing (the fact that she can breathe fire is often brought up so it's likely a rare or unique ability to her and not a common Dragon ability). \n\nShe's a big fan of the manga artist Rindou Houki who she imagines as someone who's kind and good at looking after others.\n\nEnjoys playing games and was the playable side in the shiritori mini-game during the Dragon Explorer event.\n\nWas one of the 5 characters (other than Main Character) to appear in the Rino in Wonderland event playing the Queen of Hearts role. Even though Homare took up the Chancellor role (which is technically a position lower than the Queen) they still maintained their hierarchy since Inori still can't defy Homare.\n\nAnd yes not a typo her \u26056 UB is Awaking Roar not Awakening Roar.\nSpoilers below copy and paste somewhere else (or expand formula bar if you're on PC) to see:\nShe received her Dragon avatar from Homare who she describes as a strange old lady constantly grinning. Little does she know that the Rindou Houki that she admires and Homare are the same person. The chibi face that Rindou drew as a bonus for her manga which she described as the portrait of a kid she dotes on who's a little silly and hard to ignore and hasn't warm up to her yet but that's the cute thing about her (which Inori envies and thinks is rude to not be grateful for Rindou's affection) is actually a portrait of herself.",
        "Review": "\nAn AoE character with not much to note; not that she's bad, but she's pretty straightforward. Can be used anywhere except against single bosses in general, but does considerably better in Arena than other content.\nHer UB had a bug that allowed the Burn and Push to go through physical Barriers, but Cygames fixed that almost immediately. This brings down her effectiveness as a character with an AoE push in Arena since players intended to use her to counter Rima and Yui's barriers.\nSkill 1 has crap damage, but it's surprisingly fast and will stop many characters' first Skill, further fortifying her status as an Arena specialist.\nAll in all, can be effective in Arena, but only if the enemy doesn't have Rima and/or \u26056 Yui since her firepower isn't amazing so the debuffs on her UB will get negated a lot.\nHer Unique Equipment boosts Skill 1's damage slightly, adds on a small Push, and also increases its AoE (from 315 to 515). This further pushes her to becoming one of the most widely-used Arena characters.\nWhile a powerful Arena lead, watch out for Summer Misogi as the latter is faster than Inori and will land her Stun before you do.\n\u26056 UB's Burn damage goes up by 4% of her P.ATK (also now lasts 12 ticks instead of the 11 prior to \u26056). The self-buffs on \u26056 UB last the entire battle. The AoE and knockback distance remain the same as pre-\u26056 UB's."

        "Review": "\nVanguard physical attacker with a Stealth buff, but she uses it mainly for offensive purposes compared to Phantom Thief Ayumi.\nStealth makes it such that enemies will no longer target her with normal attacks, Skills and Union Bursts (i.e. AoE attacks can still hit her if she's not the primary target but is within range). Stealth lasts 19 seconds, but gets dispelled if she gets hit by an AoE attack.\nUB and Skill 1's base damage doubles when Inori is in Stealth. Stealth is dispelled when she takes damage, so while she's an incredibly powerful attacker, she's also not suited for use against bosses with AoE attacks, making her an anti-Wyvern/Goblin Great specialist.\nSkill 2's Action Speed and P.ATK boosts last 18 seconds instead of the standard 12 seconds, and combined with the Action Speed boost, gives it a higher uptime than the loop pattern tells. The Stealth buff lasts 19 seconds (or until she gets damaged).\nUB's description's say 1 hit is guaranteed to proc Critical, which is kind of misleading but it's actually the first hit that has guaranteed Critical. Damage distribution is 50%\u219210% * 5, so at least half of the UB's total base damage benefits from it.\nBoth TP recoveries on Skill 1 and 2 are fixed amounts so they do not go up with Skill level.\nAt \u26055 and assuming only the first hit procs Critical, UB does at least 1643062 damage (assuming her P.ATK and Stealth buffs are active). P.Critical damage buff seems to kick in before the damage so UB will always benefit from it as long as she uses it while in Stealth.\nAt \u26055, Skill 1 does 652761 damage (assuming her P.ATK, Stealth and P.Critical Damage buffs are active).\nAs mentioned, Stealth is dispelled if she takes damage, so it's possible to maintain it with a Barrier that's strong enough to lower incoming damage to 0 (most notably Karin's, since Karin also has an Action Speed buff that stacks with Inori's).\nOutdamages even \u26056 attackers against bosses that won't dispel her Stealth, but near-useless against any with AoEs that can reach her.\nHas some Arena affinity when used as the frontmost character because Skill 2 procs quickly, forcing enemies to move forward to acquire the next nearest target (and delaying their attacks). Note that there are characters that are faster than Inori and will cause this strategy to fail.\nAt \u26055, Skill 1+ does 887808 + 295936 damage (assuming her P.ATK, Stealth and P.Critical Damage buffs are active). With buffers, she can easily hit the 850k soft cap line, making the additional hit somewhat useful.\nUnique Equipment boosts her damage output massively but as mentioned, she's terrible against any enemy with AoE attacks so the fact that she has a very niche usage still remains."

        "Misc. Information": "The 25-year-old Guild Master of Dragons' Nest. A mysterious Dragon who seems to know a lot about the secrets of Astrum. She constantly smiles and keeps her eyes closed but has some dark side to her which makes many people wary of her (including Inori who fears her and calls her that woman behind her back). She has a small dragon-like organism called 'Largo' constantly by her side and in battle often leaves the fighting to it while she just stands by.\n\nOn the surface Dragons' Nest is a Guild that aims to take in the rare Dragon-type Beasts under their protection and takes requests from the Guild Management Association like most other Guilds. On top of that they also take in orphans like street children under their protection. However underneath all that Dragons' Nest operates as a gang that has a subsidiary organisation called Long Ku Family (Ronkuu is either the Chinese pronunciation using Japanese phonology for \u7adc\u9aa8 or \u7adc\u7a9f which means Dragon Bones or Dragon Cave literally respectively) and has a powerful presence in the underground world of Astrum.\n\nDragon-type Beasts have a unique ability called 'Awakening' which powers them up exponentially when used. However this ability does not come by default (Homare is the exception) and the requirements to acquire it vary from person to person so Homare often makes Kaya and Inori go through dangerous situations to see to brute force the learning process (Kaya Inori and Shefi have acquired theirs).\n\nHomare herself has another unique ability called 'Ryuugan' (Dragon Eye). This ability allows to see everything from far distances (and is heavily implied to see beyond a lot of things including the secrets of Astrum). She opens her eyes and they glow red when the ability is being used.\n\nHer name in real life is Toono Homare and is a friend and former schoolmate of Ruka's and they have been hanging out since their school days. She is also friends with Jun which given their ages is also likely a former schoolmate.\nHeavy spoilers below copy and paste somewhere (or expand the formula bar if you're on PC) to read at your own risk:\nThe one thing in common with Dragons is that the recognition impairment applied to players in Astrum (in order to make them forget that the world they live in is not a real one) only works on them to a certain extent. Kaya and Inori only knows that mountains and stuff look different from before Shefi and Zen have memory loss but Homare knows a lot more.\n\nHomare is a manga artist who uses the pen name Rindou Houki. Her manga in Astrum is also a code that hides instructions for her underlings which is why they seem to carry out their jobs without her telling them directly.\n\nShe has been shown to have repaired the time-travelling device Timelabe (-labe likely taken from astrolabe an astronomical instrument) after it was destroyed in the Time Traveller event and has been using it to jump back in time to observe Main Character and gang occasionally interfering and altering history. This her Ryuugan ability and information from her client (see below) together are the reason why she knows so much about Astrum and its secrets including the events with Kaiser Insight.\n\nHer main profession is actually of a hacker and a very proficient one at that. She came to Astrum AFTER players were trapped in the game under the instructions from a certain woman (implied to be the last Seven Crowns member). She said that her relationship with that person is more of a mutual partnership than a client-consultant (though she said she WAS a friend implying they fell out at some point) as they both have their own goals and that her own goal is simply to enjoy Astrum to its fullest (and carrying out investigations on the client's behalf while she's at it). Dragons exist in the game's code (created by Minerva) but were not implemented; Homare hacked the game and gave herself a Dragon avatar (which is probably what she meant when she said she's a cheater or at least part of it). She's so proficient at hacking that she was able to backtrack the connection from when Ameth showed Main Character and her a Dream constructed from their memories in the real world and managed to do the same thing herself without Ameth. Also Labyrista came to her to ask for help in dealing with Rage Legion but was not able to get into her room which she described as heavily protected.\n\nHer intellect hacking skills and eccentricity make her pretty similar to the Seven Crowns. In fact she herself spread the rumours of herself being the last Seven Crowns member (in order to lure Rage Legion out) and Misora took the bait showing how it's pretty convincing.\n\nWhile her goal is just enjoying Astrum to its fullest she wants to solve the mystery and repair the world because it bothers her that many people are trapped in the game against their wishes. She is not interested in Rage Legion because they are mere pawns and is only interested in their sponsor (i.e. Eris). Labyrista describes her as being crazy as she said she thinks the current broken Astrum is also fun in its own way and she doesn't mind risking her life in it.\n\nIt is implied that Labyrista was her classmate/schoolmate in elementary school who she describes as a 'genius girl who can do everything' and 'she admired her not because she can do everything but because she looked like she truly enjoys whatever she does'. It is not explicitly mentioned that Labyrista is the girl but their ages (i.e. both are 25) Homare's unnatural way of denying it when Labyrista asked if they met before and her description of the girl match Labyrista's profile.\n\nHomare has a loose sense of morality though she is not evil. Her job as a hacker and her personality (i.e. doing anything as long as she is having fun) means she's often doing something illegal but she justifies her actions. For example she says she cheats in the game because the Seven Crowns have cheat-like statuses too and she wants to play with them on even grounds.\nHas voice interactions with Inori Kaya Labyrista and Shefi. Sadly none with Ruka and Jun so far.",
        "Review": "\nMagical Rearguard that provides numerous offensive debuffs that boost damage received by enemies and is also capable of doing high damage herself.\nRyuugan is a unique debuff that lasts the entire battle. It does nothing by itself but is accompanied by a new debuff that increases damage taken from magical attacks.\nThe debuff that increases damage taken from magical attacks and the debuff that increases damage taken from Critical attacks stack multiplicatively. With both active, it increases the damage of magical attacks by a whopping 23.2% when proccing critical hits.\nVery strong anti-boss character that does well in most content outside of Arena.\nDoesn't do as well against multiple enemies (unless the boss has the highest M.ATK), as she heavily relies on her Ryuugan debuff to proc the additional effects and Ryuugan is only applied by Skill 1 (2 times in 7 actions in her loop pattern) and the initial SP Skill.\nIn the case the boss also happens to have the highest M.ATK, she actually does pretty well as an AoE attacker with the likes of New Year Neneka on the team (though it's mostly due to the latter being broken)."

        "Misc. Information": "Limited character. 26-year-old Guild Master of Richmond Trade Association (\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u5546\u5de5\u4f1a | ricchimondo shoukoukai).\n\nHer name Creditta Cashe (\u30af\u30ec\u30b8\u30c3\u30bf\u30fb\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 kurejitta kyasshu) seems to be a pun on credit and cash and true to this name money is the most important thing to her though this mindset gradually changes through her interactions with Bishokuden. She has a haughty attitude and looks down on commoners but it's actually a form of inferiority complex as she revealed that she was extremely poor herself (she described the monster delicacy that Bishokuden eats as better than the food scraps from garbage dumps) and made it up to her current position through sheer hard work. Her attitude is also mostly only on the surface as her secretary described as someone who is unable to carry out evil deeds (making her somewhat of a tsundere character).\n\nShefi said she's a little like Kyaru (which the latter is shocked to hear). Funnily enough both Creditta and Kyaru are the only characters to address Karin as Shitty Glasses (\u30af\u30bd\u773c\u93e1 | kusomegane). Kyaru's nickname for Creditta is Raccoon Dog Glasses (\u30bf\u30cc\u30ad\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd | tanukimegane).\n\nHer name in the Real World is Claire Voyancia (\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30dc\u30e4\u30f3\u30b7\u30a2 | kurea boyanshia) an investor from overseas (she mentioned she came over from Sydney but it's not explicitly mentioned if she's Australian). Has a past very similar to her Astrum counterpart (i.e. used to be poor made it big through hard work but got scammed) and has difficulties trusting people as a result. Her Astrum secretary (named Ichigo according to Creditta's character story) is her online game buddy in the Real World and seems to be underaged (the game describes her as a \u5c11\u5973 which is typically used to describe a girl under 20). Ichigo gifted her with a T-shirt which says Southern Hemisphere (\u5357\u534a\u7403 | minamihankyuu) which Claire herself can't read because she isn't good with kanji which Ichigo says suits her since she crossed the equator over to Japan (likely a dirty joke from Ichigo too since \u534a\u7403 is also used to describe boobs shaped like semispheres). This T-shirt was available for purchase during Priconne Fest 2023.\n\nThe name Claire Voyancia is a double pun: 'clairvoyance' in Japanese is \u900f\u8996 (toushi) which is also the pronunciation for 'invest' in Japanese \u6295\u8cc7 (toushi). Ichigo's name is also a pun on how Creditta addresses her in-game; Creditta calls her Secretary No. 1 instead of by name which is pronounced 'hisho ichigou' in Japanese. Due to how ridiculous the name Claire Voyancia is and how she mentioned she doesn't trust others it may not be her real name.\n\nHas voice interactions with Pecorine to whom she became her biggest fangirl pledged absolute loyalty to after events in the story.\n\nHesokuri (\u3078\u305d\u304f\u308a) refers to personal funds typically used for personal savings saved up in secret from family etc.",
        "Review": "\nRearguard physical AoE attacker that can also debuff and support. Designed for use against multitarget bosses and multiple enemies, though note that her UB multipliers are rather low even with 5 or 6 targets so she's more debuffer than attacker.\nSkill 1's P.DEF debuff is permanent. The first permanent DEF debuff in the game, and is one of the only two so far (the other being Liberator Nozomi).\nUB P.DEF debuff,1 enemy: 172 | 2 enemies: 257 | 3 enemies: 343 | 4 enemies: 428 | 5 enemies: 514 | 6 enemies: 599\nUB damage (\u26055),1 enemy: 100620 | 2 enemies: 131828 | 3 enemies: 163036 | 4 enemies: 194244 | 5 enemies: 225452 | 6 enemies: 256659\nSkill 2 lasts for 10.5 seconds instead of the usual 12 seconds.\nShe's not really a main attacker, but her permanent P.DEF debuff and extremely high P.DEF debuff make her an automatic shoe-in when using physical parties against multitarget bosses or content with multiple enemies (eg. Luna Tower), while providing the party with a TP Regen buff. One of the few balance breakers in the game alongside New Year Kyaru and New Year Neneka (post-Unique Equipment) and must-have characters.\nHer Unique Equipment gives Skill 1 a negligible damage boost and more importantly, an additional debuff that increases Critical damage taken (although by just 2%). This debuff, like the P.DEF debuff, lasts the entire battle. The AoE hasn't changed though."

A simplified way to describe her would be that she's Muimi taken to the extremes trying to take responsibility for tragedies that happened indirectly because of her.\n\nWhen she was still a kindergartener her parents tried pushing her into TV limelight showing off her powers in an attempt to get famous. This attracted the attention of a terrorist group (likely named Copernicus) and they kidnapped her. For over 10 years she was held captive and was used as a human experiment in order to create weapons of mass destruction based on her powers which were used to kill countless people (eg. blowing up a VIP plane and showing the video of the explosion to Misora). Misora somehow managed to get away from them at some point (how she managed to do so has not been mentioned yet but considering the public's response and Kaiser Insight mentioning there were U.N. documents regarding the organisation possibly rescued by law enforcement). People around her all blamed the terrorists for the tragedy and said she's a pitiful victim as well but Misora blamed herself instead saying the deaths wouldn't have happened if she weren't born into this world. Her experiences caused her to become jaded and she gave up on everything (describing herself as being in a given-up-on-life mode).\n\nShe decided to help Eris because she saw her as someone more pitiful than herself. Similar to how Muimi claims to aim to become the no.1 villain Misora also started to pretend to be a psychopathic villain (pretending to a certain extent; she has said that those are part of her as well) to get everyone to hate her and stop seeing her as pitiful because she thinks the victims (of the weapons created via her powers) wouldn't be able to rest in peace otherwise. It is heavily implied that the thing she wants the most is to receive the punishment that she thinks she deserved but was denied by people in the real world like how she asked Pecorine to execute her after protagonist and gang beat her (Pecorine hit her gently on the head and forgave her instead causing her to lose the will to fight for a period of time). As she is the only person Eris trusts Eris offered to send her back to the real world before Astrum's destruction (since players still in it will be pulled along into its destruction) but Misora declined saying she should go out with Astrum like the villain she is. It is because of this nature of hers that she hates it when people take pity on her (eg. when Miyako casually remarked that she's a pitiful person). This is especially true against Muimi because of their similarities but Muimi's experiences being much milder in comparison and she described Muimi as being a villain on the surface whereas she's an actual one.\n\nUnlike Muimi whose powers are restricted by the Seven Crowns (though she's still capable of using it to a small extent as shown when she defended herself from the first Astrum Reboot and kept a large part of her memories intact) Misora can freely use her powers in Astrum and has been shown to have a wide variety of abilities (more than what Muimi has been seen to use in the real world) making her one of the most powerful individuals in Astrum by far (though she rarely goes all out\u2014like in the aftermath of Legion War where she was just sitting on the ground without a single scratch whereas the rest of Rage Legion were battered\u2014she has said that she doesn't enjoy fighting). She's also quite intelligent being the one to advise Eris on sending the failed samples (Shefi and Zen) to protagonist and Rage Legion respectively instead of just getting rid of them and outwitting individuals like Azold though she wasn't capable of seeing through Homare's lies about herself being a Seven Crowns member.\n\nAs mentioned her motives for helping Eris simply boiled down to Eris is a pitiful person so it's not actual loyalty. As Eris got closer to achieving her goals to be with protagonist Misora's motivation in helping Eris also goes down since Eris gets less and less pitiful. After she kidnapped protagonist and sent him to Eris' location she decided to end her assistance to Eris and went on with other things that she wants to do. This included freeing Kaiser Insight from his prison in order to interrogate him on whether he had anything to do with an Esper-research organisation named Copernicus (Kaiser Insight's answer was no for the curious) and going on a date with protagonist after seeing Eris and other girls' interactions with him and taking a back seat and watching Astrum's last moments.\n\nHer Character Stories seem to take place in between Labyrista and Yui saving protagonist from Eris and the end of Arc 2 where she lost motivation in helping Eris and is simply doing whatever she wants before Eris destroys Astrum. She tries to go on a date with protagonist to see if she could become a normal girl if her like for protagonist turns into love but at the same time she also desires being hurt by people she likes (as the ultimate punishment for her involvement in the tragedies mentioned above) so she's hoping for protagonist to utterly reject her after she falls in love with him (either way works out fine for her; if protagonist doesn't reject her she'll get hated by the other girls so it's still a form of punishment for her). At some point she changes her mind and tries to do a double suicide by taking protagonist along as they fall off a tower but she instinctively teleports them to safety right before they hit the ground after seeing protagonist attempting to save her even in those situations. The dream that protagonist sees of him and Misora in the real world while they fell was an image created by her Esper ability Synesthesia. Interestingly she also makes reference to the Misora route bad end eloping with protagonist even though Eris would tear her apart (implying those weren't merely gag 'routes' but rather alterate world lines that do exist).",
        "Review": "\nMagical all-rounder attacker with party-wide buffs, M.DEF debuffs and multi-attack Skills.\nMisora does not do any normal attacks. She uses an SP Skill that puts her in PSI\u2605Charge form for 12 seconds, giving herself a powerful Regen and a small M.DEF debuff to her attacks.\nThe buffs on Skill 2 last the entire battle.\nLike Shiori and Mio, Misora attacks 3 times regardless of the number of enemies. If there are 3 or more enemies, the nearest 3 enemies each get hit once. If there are only 2 enemies, the nearest enemy gets hit once, the 2nd enemy gets hit twice. If there's only 1 enemy, it gets hit thrice. Despite the Skill descriptions, the multipliers aren't actually affected by the distance between Misora and the target; even if it's just a single-target boss, each attack will do more damage than the last. Both Misora's Skill 1 and UB count as multi-attacks so they can ignore the damage soft cap to a certain extent (though difficult given the low multipliers).\nThe TL;DR version: she's a versatile attacker that does equally well against any enemy, be it single-target or multi-target (as long as it has 3 or less parts).\nSkill 1 has 0 idle time before it, meaning she can immediately use it without delay after an action ends, so Action Speed buffs have no effect on Skill 1. It's quick enough that she can maintain PSI\u2605Charge on herself almost all the time (with only the last Skill 1 at the end of her initial movement not benefitting from PSI\u2605Charge).\nThe M.DEF debuffs via PSI\u2605Charge applies only once per Skill 1 or UB usage, not thrice. Debuffs applied on one part of a multi-target boss is shared across the entire boss so the debuffs being single-target won't be a problem.\nUnlike straightforward attackers like Princess Kyaru and Anne & Grea (who can easily reach peak potential), Misora has the potential to do monstrous damage but also is extremely dependent on buffs due to the rubbish base damage multipliers, making powerful buffers like Neneka (all three versions), Ameth, Stage Misaki, etc, almost a must."

That said, you do lose out on normal attack damage since her normal attacks are magical, not physical.\nUB's P.Critical buff goes up by 50 per ally within the AoE, while the P.Critical Damage goes up by 2% (additively) per ally. The description doesn't take this into consideration so in practice it's at least 80 and 3% respectively (counting Precia herself).\nSkill 2's P.Critical buff also goes up by 50 per ally within the AoE.\nLike most other buffs and debuffs, increased Critical damage taken debuffs also stack (additively). Skill 1 and 2 combined increases your Critical damage against the enemy by 10%, which is then multiplied by the P.Critical Damage buff her UB gives.\nHer damage output isn't very high despite not having the same problems as Magical Tomo, one should view her as a offensive buffer that happens to deal decent damage (as a support).\nHer skills do not benefit from M.Critical Damage buffs. Also, the flat ATK boost from Princess Knight Enhancement: Element Level only adds M.ATK to her, not both P.ATK and M.ATK (i.e. it only looks at the character's normal attack type, like skills that target physical/magical types)."

This makes TP support very important for her as ideally, you want to avoid Overheating. Fortunately, her base TP Fill Rate is pretty decent so it doesn't take a lot to ensure she never Overheats (eg. pairing her with Creditta with Unique Equipment alone is more than enough), unless the enemy can sap TP gauges.\nOne of the very few characters with a HP UP EX Skill. At \u26055, she has a whopping 72851 max HP, fairly high for a non-\u26056 attacker.\nThe buffs on UB are permanent buffs (or until dispelled), and the Action Speed debuff on Overheat is also permanent. System Down lasts for 3 seconds and prevents her from doing anything (essentially a Stun).\nAction Speed buffs are not counted among Status UP effects so Overheat doesn't dispel the one on her UB; the Action Speed debuff is simply there to balance it to 0% (300 - 300) so it doesn't actually lower Croce's Action Speed to below 0."

Information": "The Princess of Gio Teogonia and master of Castle of Parfait. \n\nHer Royal Family Equipment Superbia is thought to be the most destructive of the series but also has the downsides of giving her a different personality that is arrogant and overbearing (superbia is Latin for 'pride' one of the Seven Deadly Sins). This is also shown in her EX Skill name \u50b2\u6162\u306a\u308b\u96f7 (goumannaru ikazuchi | 'The Arrogant Thunder').\n\nHas voice taglines with Croce Pecorine and Misogi. ...no idea why only Misogi but not Mimi and Kyouka as well (all three played with her in the story).\n\nLailael is an angel associated with the night in certain mythologies as well as conception and pregnancy. Other names for the angel include Layla(h) Leliel Laila(h) Lailahel (Lailael/Lailahel seems to be the nearest to Cygames'). It is seen as male or female and good or evil depending on the interpretation which I assume is the inspiration for Cygames' Lailael having split personalities. One of her Character Stories is literally named Angel of Night.\n\nFrontal thunderstorm is an actual phenomenon (albeit an outdated term rarely used nowadays) describing a thunderstorm that forms at a weather front (i.e. two air masses of different temperatures clashing into each other and forming a convection). The \u754c in \u754c\u96f7 (kairai) doesn't come from \u4e16\u754c (sekai | 'world') but rather \u754c\u9762 (kaimen | 'interface' in physical sciences) which in turn comes from \u5883\u754c (kyoukai | 'boundary'). It would become 'boundary thunderstorm' if I translated it literally but that doesn't make much sense in English.\nAside from Lailael she's also likely based on Barakiel as well (refer to Gio Teogonia spoiler section for more info). This might explain why she seems to have powers based on both thunder/lightning and the night; \u767d\u96f7\u591c\u5929 (byakurai yaten) means White Lightning Night Sky if translated very literally.",
        "Review": "\nFirst character to have an Environment Effect Skill, which affects all allies and enemies alike (think of Field effects if you've played GRANBLUE FANTASY). Outside of that, Lailael is a powerful buffer, debuffer and single-target magical attacker in one.\nFrontal Thunderstorm (\u754c\u96f7 | kairai) lasts the entire battle. It increases the magical damage of all allies and enemies by 10%, and deals 1% of the target's max HP in damage (capped at 99999) to all physical allies and enemies whenever they take an action (including UB).\nInterestingly, this damage is neither physical nor magical (unlike DoTs, which count as physical damage and will be blocked by physical barriers) and ignores both physical and magical barriers.\nThis 10% boost to magical damage is a new buff category that stacks multiplicatively with every existing effect so far, including Homare's debuff that increases magical damage taken.\nAll her other buffs and debuffs last the standard durations (i.e. 12s for regular Skills, 18s for UB).\nOfficial in-game explanation for Environment Effects:\n - Environment Effects occur regardless of enemies and allies (i.e. it affects both sides equally).\n - Both your side and the enemy side are allowed to activate 1 type of Environment Effect each.\n - If both sides activate the same Environment Effect, the effects do not stack.\n - Environment Effects activated by the opposite side will not overwrite the other's. A second Environment Effect activated by your side will overwrite your previous one (eg. your Lailael's Environment Effect will overwrite your Nephi\uff1dNela's).\n - Environment Effects end when the unit that activated it reaches 0 HP.\nIf you're wondering why bother listing damage and buff values when Frontal Thunderstorm is not active if Environment Effects cannot be overwritten anyway?, Lailael's SP Skill can be stopped by Stuns quick enough.\nBe careful if you're using her in content with multiple battles (eg. quests, SP and EXHIBITION+ bosses) and she goes into the next battle with a near-full TP gauge, since she'll likely start using SP Skill and cancel it with UB if you're using Instant UB."

This story is also said to be the origin of the cicada's husk meaning.\n\nHas tag lines with Nea Quria and Mitsuki.\nGio Gehenna",
        "Review": "\nPowerful Midguard all-rounder support that can lower enemies' offensive and defensive capabilities, buff allies' DEF, heal, provide TP recoveries and TP disrupt. She can also deal a lot of DoT damage.\nHer DoT damage is like Akino's; it is based on ATK stats and is subject to defense calculations. Particularly good in Arena as it automatically switches type according to the targets' defense, and can deal significant damage to multi-target bosses depending on your setup.\nShares a lot in common with Princess Kokkoro, but steering towards the defensive side (albeit having much better DEF debuffs).\nLike P.Kokkoro, she can fit in all parties regardless of type, can be used as a tank (P.Kokkoro has much higher DEF, but Anemone has a lot more HP and Utsusemi), can heal, lower enemy DEF and provide a bit of TP support. Note that Utsusemi only blocks 1 hit, not 1 attack.\nUB's descriptions doesn't specify, but it covers the entire field and thus affects all enemies. All the effects from UB last 18s (18 ticks on the Regen and DoT damage).\nHer Skills benefit from both P.ATK and M.ATK buffs. A single Skill 1+ from P.Kokkoro for example, bumps UB's total damage from 826686 to 1095390.\nLike P.Kokkoro, her Regen is a Field-based one so it can stack with all other Regen buffs, including P.Kokkoro's."

        "Review": "\nPhysical Midguard with high defensive stats, invincibility (like Miyako's) and Taunt, as well as party-wide debuffs and attacks, and can also disrupt enemies' TP. Seemed to be designed for Arena (mainly defensive) for most parts.\nBoth her Taunt and Invincibility last only 3 seconds, regardless of Skill Levels. Her DEF stats are higher than attackers, but nowhere near an actual tank like Miyako or Nozomi's or even a pseudo-tank like Matsuri (especially with the lack of a DEF EX Skill).\nAnother example of jack of all trades, master of none. She's slightly beefier than most AoE attackers but her damage output is also lacklustre compared to them, while her debuffs (other than the TP Fill Rate debuff, which is massive) don't particularly stand out.\nWhat Skill 1+ meant by except enemies that already have full TP gauges is that it only chooses from enemies that don't have a full TP gauge to be the target (i.e. centre of the AoE), not that enemies with a full gauge are immune to the attack."

Djeeta is a 'Skyfarer' in training and her dreams is to become a proper Skyfarer like her father and travel to the end of the skies like he did. Her hobbies are adventuring and talking. She is currently taking up requests and earning money earnestly in order to purchase her own skyship so that she can start on her adventure. She invited Main Character into her Crew and she is trying to get it recognised as a Guild.\n\nDjeeta was originally a collaboration character like Monica in the previous game. Monica has been upgraded to becoming an official character in Re:Dive though while Djeeta remains categorised as a collaboration character and hence isn't treated as canonical within the PRINCESS CONNECT! universe. Like Arisa and Luna Djeeta is unlikely to get any alternate versions. The game has treated them as non-canonical for a long time but the last chapters to Arc 2 surprised everyone by introducing the permanent collaboration characters into the story (i.e. Djeeta Anne Grea Arisa Luna and Vampy) somewhat. That said they have not been mentioned in the main story after that.\n\nDjeeta is the Real World is a girl from overseas who transferred into Main Character's class. She is also a player of Legend of Astrum.\n\n'Tatsumaki no Koujin' (\u7adc\u5dfb\u306e\u653b\u5203) = 'Koujin of Tornado'. As to what 'koujin' is it's a made-up term from GRANBLUE FANTASY that is used for all the pure ATK UP Weapon Skills and literally means 'Offensive Blade'. Tatsumaki no Koujin is the Medium Wind ATK UP Weapon Skill in GBF.\n\nHer \u26056 art features Djeeta as The Glory (Glorybringer in the English translations) a EXII Job in GRANBLUE FANTASY. Her assets are also labeled as such (eg. fx_djeetaglory1_tex_030)\nSeiga Itten (\u661f\u6cb3\u4e00\u5929) is The Glory's Job weapon (Heroic Weapons/Class Champion Weapons) Ridill's Ougi.\nAurea (\u30a2\u30a6\u30ec\u30a2) is Ridill's pre-evolution weapon Ashkelon's Ougi. Ashkelon is also Djeeta's Unique Equipment in this game.\n\nOnly character to get upgrades to Skills 1 and 2 upon \u26056 a reference to GRANBLUE FANTASY's Job Change system. Her EX Skill also has a different name (same effect) and her UB's cut-in animation has also changed (all other characters still have the same cut-in animation pre and post-\u26056). Because of this unique mechanics it seems like Cygames decided to create a new unit that replaces Djeeta upon upgrading to \u26056 (same looks different unit ID and Skills) for simplicity's sake and there's a unit_conversion table specially for Djeeta. This new unit also uses the same unit ID as the Hashimoto Kanna collaboration unit's ID on the Chinese servers so it's safe to assume that JP will never get that unit (most Japanese players don't want that unit to get added anyway).",
        "Review": "\nA self-accelerating single-target attacker with above average damage output. Djeeta was seen as a rather mediocre attacker for a long time, until her Unique Equipment was implemented.\nHer Unique Equipment not only boosts Skill 1's damage, it also adds on a powerful party-wide TP boost. 200 to herself, and 100 to the rest. This turned her into one of the best attackers for many content as she's now a TP battery that also deals decent damage.\nNot only does she speed up your party's TP fill rates, she also increases her own by a large amount. This in turn gives her a huge boost to her damage output, turning her into a pretty respectable attacker.\nHer Unique Equipment gives TP Fill Rate, and rather nice offensive stats. Get it to max if possible.\n\u26056 UB's buff lasts the standard 18 seconds. It also kicks in after the damage, so her first UB won't benefit from the buff. It shouldn't be a problem for subsequent UBs to benefit from it, given her UB cycle rate, and can even stack multiple times.\n\u26056 Skill 1 now has UB-like damage multipliers (the same multipliers as her pre-\u26056 UB). It deals 416959 damage with 2 stacks of UB's self-buff, or 833918 damage on average against enemies of the same level if factoring in critical rates.\n\u26056 Skill 2 now does damage, and also gains a small boost to the TP recovery. It deals 260599 damage with 2 stacks of UB's self-buff, or 521199 damage on average against enemies of the same level if factoring in critical rates.\n\u26056 UB deals 651498 damage with 2 stacks of the self-buff, or 1302997 damage on average against enemies of the same level if factoring in critical rates.\nOne of the strongest \u26056s to ever grace the game by far, due to the special treatment given to her \u26056 Ascension. To the point some people joked that there's Tier 1, 0.5, 0 and then there's Tier Djeeta.\nFunnily enough, after she hits Skill Level 261, her Skill 2 gains a P.ATK self-buff pre-\u26056, but she loses it when you Ascend her to \u26056 (and trading it for more damage instead)."

It lasts 12 ticks.\nHer buffs and debuffs all last the standard durations (i.e. 18s for UB and 12s for the rest).\nInterestingly, her Character Story bonus gives HP instead of M.ATK (+1500 HP), so it'll benefit regular Djeeta as well.\nShe's good but note that she is positioned before New Year Neneka, which can be a bit of a pain in the ass for people running the standard Nyuneka tank strat. That leaves you with characters like Christmas Yori, Monica, Noir Kuuka and Christmas Pecorine if you want a tank (and you want a tank because she has paper defences).\nSkill 1+'s base modifiers, AoE and duration remain the same. When Crest of All Creation is active, the damage field's damage (at \u26055, without her buffs) increases from 28436 to 54929 per second.

Tanezaki also voices for Chloe in Re:Dive if you haven't noticed.\nOver in GBF Vikala is one of the Twelve Divine Generals (Zodiac) themed after the Year of the Mouse.\n\nHer Skill names (UB and Skill 1 in this case) are puns crossed between four-character idioms and the zodiac theme.\n\n - \u91d1\u7259\u795e\u7136 (kinga shinnen) is a pun on \u8b39\u8cc0\u65b0\u5e74 (pronounced the same) a formal written term used to wish someone Happy New Year often on New Year cards. The kanji have been replaced with \u91d1 (kin | 'metal' or 'gold' depending on context) \u7259 (ga | 'fang') \u795e\u7136 (shinnen | 'godlike' 'divine').\nIt's her Ougi/Charged Attack in GBF and all 12 of them (presumably the same for the remaining 3 that have yet to appear) share the same Ougi name (but vastly different animations all homages to famous fighting game moves) until they get their \u26055 (i.e.Final Limit Break).\nHer FLB Ougi is named \u767e\u5b50\u591c\u884c (hyakushi yakou) a pun on \u767e\u9b3c\u591c\u884c (hyakki yakou) which refers to a parade of oni/youkai (ogres and demons) that takes place in the middle of the night. Again \u9b3c  (ki oni) is replaced with \u5b50 here ('midnight parade of a hundred mice'). If she ever gets a \u26056 in Re:Dive it'll likely be her \u26056 Union Burst too.\n\n\n - \u4e00\u5b50\u4e4b\u5922 (ichine no yume) is likely a pun on \u4e00\u708a\u4e4b\u5922 (issui no yume) an idiom about how one's standing can change quickly like a fleeting dream (issui itself refers to the time taken to cook millet grains) and is usually used with a negative connotation where someone with a high standing is reduced to a lower status. The kanji \u708a (sui) has been replaced with \u5b50 (ne) the character used for the Rat in the Zodiac.\nIt's based on a story from \u6795\u4e2d\u8a18 (Chinchuuki or Zhen Zhong Ji in Chinese) a story from the Chinese Tang dynasty. A man named Rosei (Lu Sheng in Chinese) obtained a pillow that is said to allow one to make it big. In his dreams he made it big (a good wife got wealthy and powerful) but also lost it all as the dream went on. He woke up from the dream and realised barely any time had passed not even enough time for the millet he was cooking to get fully cooked. The English title of the story is The World Inside a Pillow.\n\nHas voice taglines with Djeeta Karin (both regular and Alchemist) and Ruka. Interestingly she's the only character that has normal taglines with Karin (Karin's 'taglines' with others are comments towards certain groups/guilds and they don't reply back). Her tagline with Ruka is presumably because they both originate from Toogoku (fictional country in Astrum based on Japan; \u30c8\u30fc\u30b4\u30af\u30fb\u6771\u56fd | toogoku/tougoku literally means eastern country).",
        "Review": "\nA physical Vanguard support with lots of P.ATK buffs and also has TP recoveries and heals. Not bad but her positioning and poor defences for a support makes her hard to use over more prominent physical supports.\nHer UB gives her immunity to damage for 4 seconds. Her Regen Field lasts 12.5 seconds (12 ticks of Regen heals).\nAll her buffs aside from the Regen Field has an AoE of 195 (covering all Vanguards and the majority of Midguards), while the Field has an AoE of 305.\nHer Field takes approximately 1.834s to deploy. Considering she has poor damage output and her utility is highly dependent on her Field (other Fields won't trigger the additional effects), it's probably better to leave Instant UB off on her when on Auto.\nUE1 gives the TP recovery a small boost (60 TP), and instead of just doubling the TP recovery (120 TP) when her Field is active, the P.ATK and P.Critical Damage buffs get a significant boost too, tripling to 18660 P.ATK and 15% P.Critical Damage.\nSkill 1+'s AoE and duration however, remains the same as before.\nhttps://priconne-redive.jp/character/#unknown02"

She is looking for her missing childhood friend Rosaria and followed rumours about her being spotted in Landsol. It is her first time being in a big city like Landsol so she asked Main Character if he could show her the way and rope around Landsol while she looks for Rosaria. The city is very big so she is slowly asking around for information on her while doing quests to earn enough money for life in Landsol. Arisa and Rosaria made a promise with each other to become Guardians of the Forest together.\n\n'Real World' Arisa is a tsundere student who transfers into Main Character's class. She keeps running into cliche scenes with Main Character (akin to stereotypical love comedy manga scenes)... N-no I'm not envious at all totally not...\nShe keeps her Elf ears though because they are only dreams that Ameth constructed. Her actual Real World counterpart? I dunno maybe she is an Elf even in real life (I mean there's a real ghost a real vampire and some real espers with supernatural powers so nothing's really that surprising at this point)... or perhaps they just haven't bothered designing a human counterpart.\n\n\u30fb'Watashi no ya ga anata wo tsuranuku!'

However, Arisa has much higher damage output and UB cycle rate.\nShe also takes up the role of an anti-magic attacker (somewhat). Skill 1's damage is pretty crap though, and it's used only once every 8 actions so it's pretty unreliable. \nHer UB cycle rate, thanks to her loop pattern containing so many Skill 2 casts, is sky high (probably the only character to outpace Djeeta's UB cycle rate). Her UB also becomes much stronger after you use it once.\nIn fact, thanks to the +10 TP Fill Rate from Rank Bonus, every Skill 2 cast past the first one gives her a guaranteed full TP gauge when factoring in the +90 TP for every action taken (+1001 TP past level 205).\nHer one problem is her fragility. She is also the frontmost Rearguard, to the point you're better off thinking she's a Midguard.\n\u26056 UB description is kind of ambiguous when translated but it means the UB goes up in damage every time she uses UB (up to 4 times), not that the damage goes up by 400%. It maxes out at 571195 damage (5th UB onwards).\n\u26056 UB damage,1st UB,332021,2nd UB,388899,3rd UB,445777,4th UB,502655,5th UB onwards,571195\nSkill 1+ for some reason, has a longer idle time before it can be used compared to Skill 1 (0.75s to 1.27s)."

Luna deals damage to allies, making her a unique high-risk-high-return TP battery (since you also gain TP from damage taken).\nShe has a hidden Skill that she uses at the start of the battle and lasts the entire battle; this gives her the ability to gain a unique stack called Otomodachi, which she spends to increase her damage dealt. Not important if you're solely looking at her as a TP battery though.\nEach Otomodachi adds 1.2 to her UB's M.ATK multiplier, so she deals 53424 (if 0 Otomodachi) | 112868 | 172313 | 231757 | 291202 | 350646 magical damage according to the number of Otomodachi she uses up (at \u26053 with EX Skill factored).\nThe damage on Skill 1 comes a split second before the TP boost, so if the target is very near a full TP gauge, you can spam taps on the character to attempt firing UB via TP gain from the damage taken, before getting the TP boost so nothing is wasted.\nWas very prominent during the New Year Kyaru days but she hasn't seen much use out of very niche situations ever since the balance-breaking cat got neutered. Still, her TP recovery is still the highest in the entire game, almost ensuring whoever gets it gets a full gauge.\nhttps://priconne-redive.jp/character/#unknown03"

Despite her status Anne is a very friendly and approachable girl who loves reading. Her best friend is fellow student at Manaria Magic Academy Grea. She claims that while she likes books they are only second to Grea's tail.\n\n'Kago' (\u52a0\u8b77) can be translated as 'protection' or 'blessing' and tend to be associated with mythical or divine stuff (eg. 'may the blessing/divine protection of X be with you'). 'Eirei' (\u82f1\u970a) is a honorary word used to refer to spirits of the dead especially people who died in battle. I chose to translate this literally into 'Blessing of the Heroic Spirit' instead since 'Blessing of the Spirit' doesn't seem to convey this well and 'Protection of the Heroic Spirit' seems to imply it's a defensive buff.\n\nShe has some qualities in common with Pecorine. Both are princesses that are friendly with all despite their statuses and they both look very similar to each other. This has led to fans joking about them being sisters (occasionally with Ruu too).",
        "Review": "\nDecent single-target attacker who functions primarily as an offensive buffer, and can be used for almost all types of content (besides Arena, in which she performs poorly at).\nWhile Anne's damage output doesn't get near the likes of Summer Kyaru and Kyouka, her forte is in her large M.ATK buffs which bring up the party's firepower.\nSkill 2 has two components: she applies Blessing of the Heroic Spirit on allies in an area around her, following it up with a M.ATK buff and a negligible Action Speed buff (both buffs having the same AoEs as Blessing of the Heroic Spirit).\nBlessing of the Heroic Spirit itself does nothing, despite the name. It serves to fulfill the condition for Anne's UB to activate its M.ATK buff.\nNeneka's M.ATK buff is much easier to use though. Of course, there's nothing stopping you from using them both, but there's a lack of spots if you want the strongest setup with a healer (Summer Io or Misato) and a tank (Kokkoro or Ooedo Kuuka).\nHer Unique Equipment has a high priority as it comes with both TP Fill Rate and TP Cost Reduction, allowing her to fill her TP gauge faster (and hence giving you more chance to use it while Blessing of the Heroic Spirit is active).\nHer Unique Equipment not only increases Skill 1's damage tremendously, it also gives it a party-wide TP boost. As long as you don't cancel Skill 2 by accident, it will always give the TP boost instead of the self-buff (which is fairly weak)."

The Omeme-chan's that she summons are part of her, so they cannot act as decoys.\nOmeme-chan completely nullifies the damage from attacks on Ruu. This allows her to act as a sub-tank with some luck, though the catch is that each Omeme-chan can only nullify 1 hit, making multi-hit attacks and DoT (eg. Poison, Curse) her nemesis.\nOmeme-chan's counterattack does pure damage and ignores defenses.\nRuu's Skill 2 has very high multipliers for a non-UB Skill; it's slightly over 20% more powerful than the standard single-target Skill. This is probably to make up for her UB's low damage.\nHer Unique Equipment increases her Omeme-chan production rate tremendously, as well as give Skill 1+ a M.ATK buff that lasts the entire battle. This potentially turns her into a powerful AoE attacker. Maybe.\nWith everything maxed out (Unique Equipment included), Ruu deals 56817 magical damage with UB when there are 5 Omeme-chan. Yeah, she's still a joke character of some sort unless you use her as a counter sub-tank.\nCould be a decent counter to annoying enemies that do multiple hits, like Magical Misaki. Magical Misaki's UB has more than 5 hits so she'll take 46650 pure damage if you have 5 Omeme-chan.\nhttps://priconne-redive.jp/character/#unknown04"

Muimi is the only person to keep (nearly) fully-intact memories of both Astrum and the Real World making her one of the central figures in the story.\nCheck out the Spoilers tab for more information as they would mostly be spoilers.\n\u30fb'Tenrou Hadanken' (\u5929\u697c\u8987\u65ad\u5263) is just the name of her sword. 'Ten' (\u5929) = Sky heaven etc. 'Rou' (\u697c) refers to a building usually a high tower Japanese pavilion inn brothel (in the old days) etc. 'Tenrou' (\u5929\u697c) would then mean idiomatically a tower that reaches into the skies possibly referring to the pillar of light that appears when she activates it. 'Ha' (\u8987) means 'supremacy' and 'dan' (\u65ad) means to 'sever' so 'hadan' (\u8987\u65ad) would idiomatically mean 'Supremacy-severing'. 'Hadan' is also a pun; \u7834\u65ad ('hadan') refers to materials that get damaged (usually to the point of separation) by factors that are not man-caused (eg. pressure). Not a fan of literal translations so I'm not going to put it together (it's why I don't bother translating names of Japanese techniques like New Year Rei and Ruka's) but you get the brief idea. It's not really meant to be deeply thought into.\n\n\u30fb'Bibiraseteyaru!' (\u30d3\u30d3\u3089\u305b\u3066\u3084\u308b\uff01) = I'll scare you! but that's pretty literal and doesn't sound too great in English. Maybe something like I'll make you piss your pants or Tremble in fear!.\n\n\u30fb'Kocchi da kocchi!' (\u3053\u3063\u3061\u3060\u3053\u3063\u3061\uff01) = 'Over here!'.",
        "Review": "\nThe second Princess Fest-limited character after Christina. Muimi is one of the strongest attackers in the game, being just behind Eriko by a relatively small margin even without Unique Equipment.\nMuimi has a one-of-a-kind playstyle; instead of depleting her TP gauge after using her UB, she transits into Tenrou Hadanken mode with her TP gauge full, and the TP gauge empties itself over time. She maintains Tenrou Hadanken for as long as there is TP remaining.\nWhat makes her so fearsome as an attacker is that her loop pattern, while Tenrou Hadanken is equipped, does not follow her normal loop pattern. It instead, consists of only Skill 1 \u2192 Skill 2. Both Tenrou Hadanken Skills have UB-equivalent damage multipliers!\nWhen in Tenrou Hadanken form, she gains TP just as usual. She relies heavily on incoming damage to maintain Tenrou Hadanken for as long as possible. This is why she is often used as a tank+attacker if possible, relying on Lifesteal and heals to stay alive.\nStatus Ailments that interrupt her movements are her nemesis, as her TP gauge continues to empty while she is incapacitated. Charm or Confusion while she is in Tenrou Hadanken makes it very easy for her to wipe your own party out. Her \u26056 fixes this problem for good!\nHer Unique Equipment doesn't bring new effects to her Skill 1s, but boosts her damage tremendously. SP 1+'s damage multipliers are the same as \u26056 Rei's UB.\nHer Unique Equipment also gives a boost to TP Fill Rate, so getting it to max (at least level 250, where it stops growing) is a high priority.\nHer \u26056 gives her immunity to immobilising debuffs (eg. Stun) for the rest of the battle after using UB once, even outside of equipping Shinha Tenrou Hadanken. UB's damage multiplier has not changed, but it now hits all enemies.\nAt \u26056 (without Criticals), SP 1+ deals 595540 + 241938 damage (additional hit deals roughly 40% of the base), while SP 2 deals 221772\u00d72 damage (443545 in total). Both additional hits on SP 1 and 2 follow the range of the base attack (i.e. SP 1+ is single-target, SP 2 is AoE).\nThe additional hits on SP 1+ and SP 2 via \u26056 are separate hits, allowing her to surpass the 850k damage soft cap to a certain extent."

Technically speaking Proof of Bond just gives her the buffs on UB while \u5171\u95d8\u4e2d (kyoutouchuu | while co-op or while fighting together (with Octo)) is the actual name of her second 'form' used in the game. It's kind of lengthy when translated so I opted for 'PoB form' instead.",
        "Review": "\nPowerful attacker+debuffer with similar mechanics to Labyrista.\nHer UB puts her in Kizuna no Akashi (Proof of Bond) form (lasts 15s), which powers up her Skills and gives her a specialised loop pattern (no normal attacks!), and UB cannot be used while in this form. Both the P.Critical Damage and Action Speed buffs last 15s too.\nNotably, she's the second character with a stackable Action Speed buff, after Karin. This buff will stack additively with all other Action Speed modifiers (including Karin's).\nUnlike Labyrista, her TP Gauge does not reset to 0 when Proof of Bond ends. This means unless you get hit with TP disruptions, you'll be able to use UB immediately after Proof of Bond ends, effectively putting her in PoB loop the entire time (if you can get a full gauge during PoB).\nHer P.DEF debuff lasts 12s, but due to her PoB loop, she can maintain multiple stacks on the target at all times. The same goes for her self-buffs on Skill 2, she can maintain multiple stacks at all times (unless they get Dispelled).\nHer TP Fill Rate stat is abysmally low (lowest in the game by far) so she'll still need some kind of TP support to keep herself in PoB form as long as possible. Hopefully her Unique Equipment will follow Overload Pecorine's example. R.I.P.\nSadly, her Unique Equipment doesn't solve her problem with TP. It just boosts the damage dealt by the initial attack, and adds on a very small P.DEF debuff on the additional attack (same damage multipliers on the additional attack)."

This ability can be used on others as well allowing her to change one's looks at will.\n\nShe has her own agenda but decided to lend Main Character a hand for now in order to break free from the current world. Despite her looks she is actually 24 years old (as revealed in the official guidebook).\n\nHas voice interactions with not just Christina Labyrista and Muimi but also Rima as well.",
        "Review": "\nThe third Princess Fest-limited character after Muimi, and the first magical one among them. Like the other Princess Fest-limited characters, Neneka is exceedingly powerful. Often considered one of the top priorities among Princess Fest characters.\nShe has high firepower, carries a powerful M.DEF debuff, and has a large AoE M.ATK and TP Fill Rate buff, allowing her to fit into any magical party easily.\nHer UB creates a clone that has the exact same stats and attack pattern as the original, and it also uses both Skill 1 and 2, which is what makes her damage output and debuff so reliable.\nHer clone also immediately uses Skill 2 without delay upon being summoned (though Skill 2's long ~1.7s animation still applies), essentially meaning UB = Skill 2 M.DEF debuff, increasing her reliability. If you're able to use UB frequently, it's not uncommon to have 3 or 4 stacks of Skill 2's M.DEF debuff on the enemy, making her a far better debuffer than on paper.\nSome strats against bosses with powerful single-target attacks revolve around Neneka using her clone as a 'wall' that protects your lead. The clone has a shorter 'attack range' than the original (search area width of 460 vs the original's 660), and will be summoned quite some distance ahead of the original, allowing the 'wall' strat to work. Most notably, New Year Neneka has a wider search area width at 562, which means the clone can take attacks on New Year Neneka's behalf if the latter is the frontmost character.\nShe is also surprisingly decent in Arena (mostly against wall setups), as Skill 1 is an AoE attack with high damage multipliers, and it also carries a Stun. The Stun is very short at just 0.5s long, but can interrupt enemy Skills.\nHer one major weakness is that she is extremely fragile. She is also among the frontmost Rearguards, so she often gets hit by AoE attacks. Mitsuki's P.DEF buff would lower her P.DEF to 0, and even without debuffs, enemies like Summer Kaori can easily kill her instantly.\nSkill 1+ gains a boost in damage, an extra M.DEF debuff as well as a boost to the Stun duration (from 0.5s to 1.5s). The AoE remains the same, however.\nMost people leave her in Instant UB all the time, since her UB buffs are too good to pass. She'll occasionally cancel her own Skills but the pros outweigh the cons.\nHer buffs can stack (the TP Fill Rate buff was also a major component of the now defunct Infinite Maho strategy). It's not uncommon to see 4 or more stacks, often bringing up TP bursts to over double their original amount.\nNot something that really matters a lot but I thought I should mention that her EX Skill stats not applying to her clone was apparently a bug, and was finally fixed 3 years after she was implemented."

        "Review": "\nVery powerful offensive buffer for a magic party, as well as functioning as a single-target healer. Extremely high priority, so if you already have core physical characters (eg. Creditta) and don't have New Year Neneka, you'll probably want to save up for her re-run.\nThe TL;DR to why she's considered top priority is because her buffs are so powerful they literally changed the game's meta. Ever since her appearance, many players would just default to use Nyuneka first against hard bosses before trying anything else, and she's one of the only few characters that make wanpan runs against many bosses that normally cannot be defeated in a single run possible (New Year Kyaru and Creditta are the other two), so it's another case of Cygames' balancing gone horribly wrong.\n8% of her M.ATK is added to her UB's M.ATK buff, while 0.3% is added to the M.Critical buff.\nAs usual with all other buffers that get a bonus based on their own ATK stats, her buffs get very negligible boosts from \u26053 to \u26055 so you're doing that mainly for her own defensive stats.\nHeals for a pretty decent amount (>10k HP with her Heal Boost factored), but note that she doesn't use her heal often (only 2 times out of 12 actions in her loop).\nAll her buffs last for the standard duration; 18 seconds for UB buffs and 12 seconds for Skill 1 and Skill 2's.\nWith her Unique Equipment, the base M.Critical buff increases slightly while the rest of the base buff remain the same. They now get a boost based on Neneka's own M.ATK and are much powerful than the UB's bonuses, but have hard caps.\n27% of Neneka's M.ATK is added to Skill 1+'s M.ATK buff. 0.6% of her M.ATK is added to the M.Critical buff. 0.0085% of her M.ATK is added to the M.Critical Damage buff.\nApproximately 73555 M.ATK is needed for her M.ATK buff on Skill 1+ to hit the cap of 26480. 60000 and 58823 M.ATK for the M.Critical and M.Critical Damage buffs respectively. As the M.ATK buff is affected by Skill Level, the amount needed will increase with the level cap.\nVery strong magic buffer ever since her release (and uncontested since her Unique Equipment), the difference between having her or not is heaven and earth. With a good party her buffs can snowball really hard and make your attackers do ridiculous damage.\nOften used as the frontmost character in a magical party because she has above-average defensive stats and she can heal herself (though not tough enough to tank against most bosses in Clan Battle 4th/5th stage onwards).\nOften used together with her regular counterpart, which some players call W Neneka (double Neneka).\nChristmas Yori pairs with her very well too, providing Neneka and the party with everything they need. She has the bulk to tank enemies too strong for Neneka, can also provide Neneka with massive TP recoveries, M.ATK and Action Speed buffs, can debuff the enemy's M.DEF and can also heal the party. Neneka has 68284 M.ATK with just Christmas Yori's Skill 1 and Skill 2 buffs alone, bringing her much closer to the threshold needed for Skill 1+'s bonuses (already 116.1% of the amount needed for the full +10% M.Critical Damage).\nHer M.ATK stat is high enough that you probably want to leave out equipment with M.ATK stat despite the TP gain-related updates, will make it a lot easier for her buff to target attackers with no M.ATK self-buffs (eg. Misora). There are also strats that do the opposite; making her the character with the highest M.ATK so Skill 1+ targets herself and speeds up UB's snowball (since UB has no cap). Make use of \u2606-change and EX Equipment for adjustments."

Descriptions mention its Skill Level is based on UB's Skill Level, but Skill Level seems to have no effect on it.\nSkill 2 behaves like a time bomb; it takes 2.5s to explode and the damage is based on Karin's stats at the point of detonation, not when she uses Skill 2 (like Halloween Misogi's UB).\nSkill 1 boosts Action Speed by 50%. Not only does it stack with other Action Speed buffs, it also stacks with itself. The double stack window is too small to actually matter when she's the lone Action Speed buffer, but you'll see this a lot when there are other buffers.\nSkill 1 stacks additively. For example, \u26056 Yui's UB (+100%) and Karin's (+50%) together will give you a 150% boost to Action Speed, which translates to a 60% reduction of idle time in between actions (1 - 1 / (1 + 1 + 0.5) = 0.6).\nAlthough her UB simply mentions Critical hits instead of physical and magical Critical hits like Princess Kokkoro's, they are the same type of buff, and stack additively (eg. Princess Kokkoro and Karin's UBs active at the same time gives you a 26% boost).\nWhile she can't heal, her UB's barriers are one of the most powerful in the game among party-wide ones, rivalling New Year Yui's."

New Year Kyaru and Transfer Student Aoi), but they're very niche cases with little or no practical use so for most parts, you wouldn't use her with Rearguards at all (aside from Cafe Tamaki)."

        "Review": "\nAll-around support that carries defensive buffs like Damage Cut, DEF UP, and damage nullifying Barriers. She can also provide extremely powerful ATK and TP support to allies that have active Barrier buffs on them.\nSingle-handedly reshaped the game meta that existed up until the point she was implemented. Considered by many players to be one of the must-have characters and often the top priority for new players.\n10% of her M.ATK is added on top of Skill 2's ATK buffs. She needs roughly 646880 M.ATK to hit the caps (this requirement will go up with Skill Level). The buffs on Skill 2 last for 18 seconds instead of the standard 12 seconds.\nThe Barrier needed for Skill 2 does not have to be Ameth's so you probably want to use her with other Barrier supports that have Barrier for max efficiency.\nWhile Barriers of the same type cannot stack, Skill 2 does absolutely nothing for characters without any Barrier on them so having more supports with Barriers increase the likelihood of your allies having an active Barrier when Ameth uses Skill 2.\nSkill 2 also reacts to Absorption Barriers, but Absorption Barriers will overwrite Negation Barriers of the same type (i.e. Physical+Magical in Ameth's case) regardless of potency. For example, \u26056 Akino's self Barrier will overwrite Ameth's.\nOther Barrier buffs that should work well with Ameth's,Physical Barriers,Magical Barriers\nDue to how Ameth's M.ATK affects her ATK buffs, she works better in magical parties than physical ones (still incredibly powerful for a physical party though). Synergises with Misaki (Stage) in particular.,Misaki (Stage)\nUB's Regen buff lasts for 10 ticks. The Barriers last for 90 seconds (or until they're depleted).\nAt \u26053, Skill 1 heals for 86463 HP when factoring in her Heal Boost stats. As it has a pretty massive M.ATK modifier, it would go up to 136432 with just 1 Skill 2 cast, and 191398 with 2 Skill 2 stacks so it should heal any character to max in most cases.\nThe game checks if a Barrier is up right as Skill 2's text bubble appears. Even if the Barrier was destroyed after the Skill animation starts, you'll still receive all the benefits. On the other hand, if the Barrier was applied mid-animation (i.e. after the bubble appears), it won't count.\nShe also does well in Arena, particularly in parties with characters that can put up Barriers often (eg. Yukari, Rima, Karin). The Ameth + Summer Chika combo is especially annoying in wall setups."

But considering Dark's lack of healers and her attack pattern, she's a much stronger healer than numbers tell.\nTo give an idea of how powerful she is, players were all stuck at 1-9 of Abysmal Quest (Deep Region) previously, but were able to effortlessly beat 3-10 after her implementation, almost entirely without manual play. Like Ameth, she's also used in a lot of non-Dark setups too."

        "Review": "\nPowerful physical offensive buffer and AoE attacker in one. All of their buffs (including self-buff) are permanent buffs. Slow starter due to Skill 2 relying on their own P.ATK for the bonuses, and ideally paired with other P.ATK buffers (though not unusable on their own).\nKind of iffy as a buffer compared to Princess Kokkoro and Labyrista, probably balanced out that way because Hatsune & Shiori also perform as a pretty powerful AoE attacker (Labyrista has shit damage).\nTheir AoE attacks hit all enemies.\n4% of Hatsune & Shiori's P.ATK is added onto the P.ATK buff in Skill 2. 0.05% of P.ATK is added onto the P.Critical buff. 0.005% of P.ATK is added onto the P.Critical Damage buff.\nFor example, \u26055 Hatsune & Shiori have 51521 P.ATK (inclusive of EX Skill). The first Skill 2 cast will boost the party's P.ATK by 2994, P.Critical by 36, and P.Critical Damage by approximately 3.58% (rounded up to nearest 2 decimal places).\nHatsune & Shiori need 69975 P.ATK in order to hit Skill 2's P.ATK buff cap (3732), and 60000 P.ATK in order to hit the P.Critical (40) and P.Critical Damage (4%) caps. While powerful, they're also a slow starter and ideally should be paired with other P.ATK buffers.\nHatsune & Shiori gains 759 TP with Skill 1 if it hits 6 enemies (eg. Dungeon EX IV), factoring in their TP Fill Rate and the +90 TP from taking an Action.\nWhile a capable buffer, note that Skill 2's AoE is small and won't reach Vanguards and some Midguards (notably, it may or may not reach Princess Rei depending on your lineup and the enemy).\nTheir capability as an attacker has significantly jumped with a shift in recent meta that puts more focus in the mid~backlines instead of frontline-oriented, particularly with Creditta's addition (she can do almost as much as Princess Rei against multitarget bosses).\nEach enemy hit by Skill 1 increases the damage's P.ATK multipliers by 0.3 and TP recovered by 25. Numbers shown in description are at 0 enemies hit, so it will always be higher in practice.\nSkill 1+ gains an additional, weaker attack (0.15 bonus per enemy instead of 0.3). Everything else remains unchanged. The additional attack deals slightly above 50% of the first attack's damage.\nSkill 1+ first attack damage (post-S.Lv260),1 enemy: 77421 | 2 enemies: 91282 | 3 enemies: 105143 | 4 enemies: 119003 | 5 enemies: 132864 | 6 enemies: 146724\nSkill 1+ second attack damage (post-S.Lv260),1 enemy: 47951 | 2 enemies: 54881 | 3 enemies: 61811 | 4 enemies: 68742 | 5 enemies: 75672 | 6 enemies: 82602"

        "Review": "\nWeird single-target attacker that has both physical and magical elements but is otherwise pretty straightforward. Don't be fooled, they're a physical attacker for most parts (see below).\nDespite the confusing Skill descriptions, the additional hit procs regardless of the enemy's DEF stats, just that it changes type according to whichever DEF stat is lower. If the additional hit is magical type, the damage will be reduced by the enemy's M.DEF instead of P.DEF.\nI've taken the liberty of altering UB and Skill 1's descriptions for clarity, as the original descriptions are extremely misleading (implying that the additional damage procs only if the target's M.DEF is lower than their P.DEF, which isn't true).\n\nOriginal UB description in Japanese for reference: \u76ee\u306e\u524d\u306e\u6575\uff11\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306b\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5927\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3068\u3001\u5bfe\u8c61\u306e\u9b54\u6cd5\u9632\u5fa1\u529b\u304c\u7269\u7406\u9632\u5fa1\u529b\u3088\u308a\u4f4e\u3044\u5834\u5408\u3001\u9b54\u6cd5\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u6271\u3044\u306b\u306a\u308b\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5927\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u308b\u3002\nDeals extra large physical damage to the nearest enemy, and if the target's M.DEF is lower than P.DEF, deals extra large physical damage treated as magical damage.\nThe self-buffs on Skill 2 are permanent. They do have a nice P.DEF debuff but as an attacker their UB is pretty run-of-the-mill (same multipliers as \u26056 Rei's).\nThey have an excellent attack pattern that uses normal attacks only once every 8 actions, resulting in her overall firepower being pretty high and the P.DEF debuff having 100% uptime.\nNote that the resulting total damage on UB shows up with yellow font (i.e. physical) even if it does both physical and magical hits (the magical portion will be based on the target's M.DEF).\nThe additional damage is based on purely P.ATK stats, even if it turns into magical type. Unlike Magical Tomo, M.ATK buffs are useless for her and she'll only benefit from the P.ATK portion of hybrid buffs.\nUB's mechanics makes breaking the 2m soft damage cap in Clan Battles possible, allowing them to outdamage other attackers.\nAt \u26055 and with +26% P.Critical Damage (eg. Karin + P.Kokkoro/S.Nozomi), it takes approximately 108485 worth of P.ATK buffs to hit 2,000,000 damage with Critical hits. P.Critical Damage buffs help lower that amount substantially so they're almost a must when using this trio.\nMore tests needed, for some reason the additional damage turned magical even against an enemy with 0 P.DEF and 2 M.DEF (1-1 mobs with P.DEF debuff applied)."

At \u26055 (with Skill 2's buff) and with 40 stacks, UB would do 2 attacks that each deal 809426 damage.\nSkill 1's M.ATK multiplier gets a 0.075 boost for every FMS stack. At \u26055 (with Skill 2's buff) and with 40 stacks, Skill 1 would do 2 attacks that each deal 224487 damage.\nAs usual, like other multi-attack Skills, both UB and Skill 1 have the potential to ignore the 2m damage softcap in certain content to a certain extent. Particularly easy with UB if you have characters like Karin, New Year Neneka and Ameth around.\nSkill 2's buffs last the entire battle.\nTheir high multipliers together with the multi-attack Skills make them a very powerful attacker against enemies that feature the 2m damage softcap, outdamaging even Princess Kyaru against certain enemies. Without the softcap though, the latter usually still has the edge. If you're a new player having trouble which to spark (assuming you already have top priorities like Ameth and Neneka), Princess Kyaru is generally the safer pick that works well across most content."

Emilia is a half-Elf who hails from a different world. She and her group helped the members of Bishokuden when they got attacked by Petelgeuse who also got sent to Astrum. They begin their search for the missing Subaru...\n\nPuck (the cute little flying mascot-like animal that treats Emilia as a daughter) made a joke about Kokkoro (who is also a silver-haired Elf) being his other daughter and Emilia's long-lost sister and Emilia taking it seriously took a liking to her and doted on her like a real sister. They still behave like real sisters even after Emilia found out it was a joke.\n\n\u30fb'Yakusoku no Hanazono' (\u7d04\u675f\u306e\u82b1\u5712) = 'Garden of Promise'\n\u30fb'Onegai Puck!' (\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3001\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\uff01) = 'Do it Puck!' or I'm counting on you Puck! would probably be the closest translations.\n\u30fb'Koori no Tsubute' (\u6c37\u306e\u98db\u792b)... 'Tsubute' refers to a small throwing rock/pebble that isn't bigger than your palm or can refer to something of a similar size used for throwing as well. 'Koori' means 'ice'. Maybe 'Hailstorm' or 'Icicle Throw' would be a better English name.\n\u30fb'Daiseirei to no Keiyaku' (\u5927\u7cbe\u970a\u3068\u306e\u5951\u7d04) = 'Contract with the Great Spirit'. 'Great Spirit' here refers to Puck a powerful Great Spirit whose true form is actually much larger and more monstrous-looking.\n\nOn a side note Takahashi voiced for Ameth in the first season of the anime (due to Aisaka stopping all activities temporarily for treatment on her throat).\n\nIf anyone is thinking lol Cygames gave Emilia Fire must be a typo no Emilia being Fire element is correct lore-wise.",
        "Review": "\nThe first proper attacker/healer hybrid character in the game.\nEmilia's equipment is a mix of both attacker and healer. While she does impressive damage for a healer, please don't have too high of an expectation because she is very far from the other attackers in terms of firepower.\nShe uses Skill 1 enough to keep her self-buff active almost all the time, making up for her relatively low M.ATK stat.\nSkill 2, unlike Summer Maho's UB, has all 4 hits hitting the same target. While still random, this makes it more reliable for Arena usage (though still not recommended). It has very high damage multipliers for a single-target attack.\nWhat she is truly good at however, are her UB's buffs. It boosts the defenses of all allies unconditionally, making her very good for Clan Battle when the buffs are needed.\nHer Unique Equipment triples Skill 1's damage and almost quadruples the self-buff, as well as lowering the idle time before the attack by a whopping 1s (from 1.77s to 0.77s). Duration of the buff remains the same at 12s.\nPrior to Unique Equipment, \u26055 Emilia's Skill 2 deals 128538 damage in total, or 230018 damage on average with Critical rates factored in.\nWith maxed Unique Equipment, \u26055 Emilia's Skill 2 deals 155497 damage in total, or 278262 damage on average with Critical rates factored in.\nWhile her damage output against a single target has been greatly increased, it still doesn't come close to Summer Maho's so take note if you plan to put resources into her for her damage."

Rem is a 17-year-old Ogre who hails from a different world and is the younger of the twin Ogre maids. Unlike her older sister Rem is good at household chores. She is grateful to the people of Astrum for easily accepting the fact that she is an Ogre and serves them dutifully while they search for Subaru.\n\nDisplays part of the madness she showed in the Re:Zero's story itself perhaps influenced by the members of Bishokuden and the rather wild and eccentric people from Astrum.\nOnigakattemasu!' (\u9b3c\u304c\u304b\u3063\u3066\u307e\u3059\uff01): Sort of like Rem's catchphrase in Re:Zero (she picked it up from Subaru when he used it to describe her). Subaru used it as a play-on-words on 'kamigakattemasu' (\u795e\u304c\u304b\u3063\u3066\u307e\u3059) which means someone is being possessed by God but also idiomatically used to describe someone pulling off an incredible as 'almost as though they were possessed by God himself'. Whereas oni (\u9b3c) refers to a demon in Japanese folklore that is slightly like ogres and trolls in Western folklore (but different) but for simplicity's sake I'll just refer to them as 'Ogres' here. 'Ogre' refers to Rem's race and is also used in youngster speech as a prefix to mean something akin to 'super' (eg. 'onitsuyo' \u9b3c\u30c4\u30e8 = 'super-strong') so it has double meanings.\n\nTL;DR Subaru is using it like 'super strong' and 'as though possessed by an ogre' while also (incidentally and unintentionally) referring to Rem being an actual Ogre (fine not double but triple meanings) but it's kinda hard to translate it into something short and catchy without losing part of its meaning.",
        "Review": "\nAn Arena AoE attacker for most part, Rem, like her sister, relies on status ailments that restrict the enemy's movement (Bind, Stun, as well as her own Freeze) to deal more damage than usual.\nNeeds other debuffer support to make full use of her UB's extra damage as her only incapacitating debuff is a single-target attack. Ram was made for that purpose, but you may want to use more characters (eg. New Year Rei, Tsumugi).\nAlthough her UB has very good damage for an AoE UB assuming the targets were incapacitated, almost every boss is immune to these debuffs (there has only been 1 boss that can be Stunned by far and it likely won't happen again) so she's no boss killer.\nCan be very good in Arena with some luck, but for most parts you're better off relying on the likes of Mimi (base \u26052), Summer Mifuyu (free) and Summer Kaori (free), since they don't need to rely on luck and have wider AoEs.\nUnique Equipment turns Skill 1 into an AoE attack but it has a relatively small AoE (150). The damage increment is pretty negligible but the duration of the Freeze debuff has been increased from 3s to 4s. This turns her into a formidable Arena character.\nAt \u26055, Skill 2 heals for 72406 HP without Unique Equipment, and 119792 with maxed Unique Equipment."

Unlike her sister Ram has a foul mouth and acts high and mighty but deep down she is a kind person. She was initially wary of the people of Astrum but it didn't take long for her to trust them as she found it silly to even doubt them with their appalling warmheartedness.\n\nShe usually doesn't step forward and do troublesome things of her own accord but she does look after Main Character (considering he has the mental capacity of a child's).\nRam no jama wo shinai de' (\u30e9\u30e0\u306e\u90aa\u9b54\u3092\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3067): Don't get in Ram's way. Oh yeah both Rem and Ram refer to themselves in third person cute.\n\n'Senrigan' (\u5343\u91cc\u773c): Literally 'Thousand-mile Eye' idiomatically used to describe someone who is all-seeing. It was based on Chinese mythology most popularly (but not initially) as a Chinese god named Qianliyan (also written as \u5343\u91cc\u773c) who can see far and beyond. It is also Ram's ability in Re:Zero allowing her to see far distances by borrowing the vision of other living things (eg. a hawk).\n\n'Gougan Fuson' (\u50b2\u5cb8\u4e0d\u905c): A Japanese yojijukugo (\u56db\u5b57\u719f\u8a9e four-character idioms) used to describe someone being haughty and arrogant (often to the point of being rude) behaving as though they look down on others. It is the best way to describe Ram's personality (by the author's admission) especially towards Subaru. For the curious the most suitable yojijukugo to describe her sister Rem would be 'ingin burei' (\u6147\u61c3\u7121\u793c also by the author's admission) which is used to describe someone who talks politely but rude at the same time (superficially polite eg. 'may I ask of you to please close that filthy mouth of yours?') which was how she behaved towards Subaru until she fell head over heels for him.",
        "Review": "\nLike Rem, also an Arena character for most part. Her kit is designed to be used in conjunction with Rem.\nHer Bind lasts a rather long 4s, which makes it as powerful as New Year Rei's. New Year Rei's is more reliable though, considering she's a tank with Taunt so she's likely to fill up her TP gauge faster than Ram.\nLike Rem's UB, Ram's Skill 1 deals more damage if the target was incapacitated when the attack connects. The push when the target is incapacitated is fairly large at more than 1 character's size worth of distance.\nSkill 2 is self-explanatory. It nullifies an entire attack, no matter the number of hits. However, note that Christina's UB will still hit, although the debuff will not be used up by it and will still nullify Christina's next attack (i.e. after her UB).\nRecently gained a niche use as a counter to Rino cannon setups (with Yukari+Yuki or Luna), when used in conjunction with Hatsune. Hatsune's initial Stun will cause Rino's UB to line up together with Ram's Senrigan, making it miss completely.\nBe careful of Yuki's Charm if you're using the Ram+Hatsune combo as a counter to Rino+Yukari+Yuki setups though. Ram tends to be the 2nd character in your setup, and Charm will cancel Senrigan so you'll get wiped by the enemy Rino.\nUnique Equipment doubles Skill 1's damage multipliers, and increases the Push distance. Push distance if the target was incapacitated has been doubled (from 300 to 600), and increased slightly from 150 to 225 if the target wasn't incapacitated."

Uzuki's type was also 'Cute' back in the original PRINCESS CONNECT! game.\n\nHer CV Oohashi Ayaka also voices for Hatsune.\n\nNote that her illustration in the game seems to be an upscaled version of a lower resolution art for some reason making it blurier compared to other characters (compare this to Rin's). Probably a bug that Cygames need to work out.",
        "Review": "\nFunctions similarly to Djeeta, except with AoE attacks and has an ATK buff for both physical and magical parties.\nHonestly, not extremely powerful (the fact that TP Fill Rate buffs don't go up with Skill level hurts) so it's expected she won't really shine until her Unique Equipment gets implemented. Pull for her only if you really like her. She isn't bad, just not Summer Saren kind of must-have.\nBoth UB and Skill 2 have rather large AoEs. One place she performs well in is Dungeon EX III, since her UB hits all parts of the boss."

        "Review": "\nUses Skill 1 a lot. Skill 1 works the same as Shiori's Tri-Arrow; she'll do all 3 hits even if there's only 1 or 2 enemies, so it's a fairly powerful damage Skill against single-target bosses.\nAt \u26055 level 310, Skill 1 does a total of 111463 magical damage before factoring her self-buff (124898 with self-buff). This means that she does fairly decent damage with the high Skill 1 frequency (at least for a healer).\nAt \u26055 level 310, Skill 2 heals for a total of 37417 HP before factoring her self-buff (42035 with self-buff), thanks to her extremely high Heal Boost stat. This makes her a pretty potent healer as well (1 heal in 4 actions is pretty good too).\nComparing characters with similar roles (both pre-Unique Equipment), Emilia does approximately 1275612 average damage over 10 actions (including her self-buff). Mio does 1104337 in comparison (without UB and its buff). Factor in Mio's UB and she does way higher damage.\nSelf-buff on Skill 1+ is a permanent buff and hence will stack indefinitely. She can use Skill 1+ up to 10 times per round/battle uninterrupted, with the first doing 250858 damage and the last doing 380172 damage (without critical and not considering her UB self-buff).\nComparing the two again after they got their Unique Equipment, Emilia does approximately 2662041 average damage over 10 actions (including her self-buff). Mio does 2608951 in comparison (without UB and its buff).\nSimilar to Shiori, the TP update (i.e. TP recoveries/disruptions that go up with level are capped at level 260) benefits her 2 times more than other characters that also get damage boosts, because of Skill 1+'s mechanics."

Rin's type was also 'Cool' back in the original PRINCESS CONNECT! game.\n\nHer CV Fukuhara Ayaka also voices for both Chika (whose Memory Piece happens to be obtainable from the collaboration event) and Grea.\n\nHer Skills are all themed after the colour blue. Iolite as a gemstone is often of a bluish violet colour and is based on the Ancient Greek word '\u00edon' (violet). Lazur is Polish for 'azure' or it may be short for 'lazulum' which is used as a root word for 'blue' in several languages (lapis lazuli got its name from lazulum). Hauyne (pronounced ah-WEEN) is one of the minerals that make up lapis lazuli and if fauceted as a gemstone on its own is highly prized for its beautiful deep blue color. Soukyuu (\u84bc\u7a79) means 'azure sky'.",
        "Review": "\nA straightforward tank with a very powerful Barrier, but note that her Barrier negates damage and not absorb, so she needs healers to stay alive.\nHer Bind debuff lasts 2.5s.\nProbably more suited for Arena since Skill 2 is useless against bosses. Shares some similarities with New Year Rei, both having Taunts, debuffs that cripple enemies, and they also share the exact same positioning (in between Kaori and Pecorine).\nLike New Year Kokkoro, she doesn't start the battle with her Taunt so you still want someone like New Year Rei or Kuuka if you want to counter certain attacks on the first turn. Doesn't make her any less powerful in Arena though.\nHas a whopping 3398 P.DEF with Skill 1+ active, reducing incoming physical damage by approximately 97.14%."
